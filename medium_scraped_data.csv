To do this, we will need to continually reinvent and refine how we provide access to services and activate consumers while ensuring much better adherence. Underlying all of this is our need to create change and new approaches, grounded in new technology, delivery models and engagement techniques. In order for us to accomplish this shift, it is critical that we understand disruption and innovation as separate but complementary concepts, create a structure to help our organizations identify disruption, and understand how we will react and respond to disruption. What is disruption in healthcare? While disruption is a “buzzword” often used across multiple industries, we need to have a foundational understanding of what that means for healthcare. At Navicent Health, we created our Center for Disruption and Innovation (CfDI) to provide clarity around these concepts, but also a structure that allows us to ultimately create a culture of change at our organization. Let’s take the definition first. When we speak about disruption, we define that as “any force, external or internal, that has the ability to fundamentally impact a business or clinical model.” When we think about innovation, we see that as “the means to create, or respond to, disruption of a market, organization or industry, leveraging new, revised and unique models.” Furthermore, when we think about our ability to create change, which is a primary outcome of the work we do with disruption, we have a simple model of “innovation –> adaption –> change.” Considering this further, we need to identify the right types of innovation that leads to adapting (not adopting, because you have to adapt an innovation to your specific and unique market and circumstances). Ultimately, this yields the creation of change which will support the evolution of our industry into one optimizing health, instead of just healthcare. Establishing the right structure to support both the evaluation and creation of disruption through innovation is foundational to any successful effort to create change. There are dozens (or perhaps hundreds!) of examples globally, but at Navicent Health, we created one that has continued to evolve and has proven successful to date. This structure has grounded our efforts to align with start-ups, address ongoing internal opportunities for improved efficiencies, appropriately “scan the horizon” for technology and models that can disrupt us (and determine how we will respond to that disruption), share the lessons learned and new knowledge through research, and commercialize the right solutions. Fundamental to all of this are the meaningful partnerships we have established both internally and externally across the world, as we began with a basic premise that we cannot do all of this work by ourselves and we are better because of the partnerships we have established. Often, when people think about disruption in the healthcare industry, they automatically gravitate toward new technologies as the source of all innovation. New innovative and disruptive technologies are an incredibly important tool to be used in advancing health across our industry and we all know examples that are in various phases of implementation, development, or conceptualization (e.g., virtual reality, artificial intelligence, wearables, ingestibles, absorbables, sensors, apps, etc.). However, while the creation of new and refined technologies is certainly needed, it is just as important to understand the importance of addressing the underlying process or model and not just the technology. If you place a new technology over a dysfunctional process or model … you’ll likely still have a dysfunctional process or model that hasn’t been addressed. Organizations need a balance between the technologies and the underlying models or processes for optimal creation of change to be achieved. While we continue to learn each day, the disruption and innovation philosophy we’ve established, coupled with the structure and process described, has allowed us to be successful in implementing innovations, reducing costs and creating new revenue streams across our enterprise, thus realizing change that prepares us to be more relevant and sustainable within the new evolving healthcare model. This is the true measure of addressing disruption as something for which we evaluate and determine our response, while also creating impactful disruption that benefits our patients and the health of our communities.

Henderson,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Robert M. Henderson Follow The Writing Cooperative -- Listen Share As a society we’re writing more than ever, we just haven’t noticed… When SMS text messaging took off into the stratosphere during the early 2000’s, the inevitable soon followed; badly spelt messages. Correction, horrifically spelt messages. For years before autocorrect, the demise of person to person communication had taken a firm grip. Once a people of beautifully composed, quill-written letters had become a society of keyboard warriors sending poorly spelt pixels from Nokia to Nokia. Remember WUU2? and BRB? Perhaps you can recall the infamous talk 2 u l8r, as a sign off. Autocorrect swept in and cleared up some of the damage, ok mass text messaging has never been writing at it’s finest, but at least with autocorrect we were tilting back towards legible, and structured, communication; even if it was being done by a microchip. Fast-forward 18 years and we’re now spending huge amounts of time reading and writing on our smartphones and laptops. We’re also less reliant on autocorrect thanks to the advancement in smartphone screens and real estate to properly engage with the keyboard. We’re spending on average 2.4hours a day on our phones and when you really think about it, that’s predominantly reading and writing time. We write emails, we write messages, we write and keep notes, we write Facebook posts and tweets, we write LinkedIn updates, we even write up Google searches. But its not usually material that we qualify as ‘writing’ because it’s now done so subconsciously at such a high frequency, that we don’t even register or qualify that we’re writing at all. Either that or we don’t register this micro-writing as actual writing because it doesn’t mean much to us. I mean, we text message because we have to, right? But we are writing, and write we must. We need to tell our Grandmothers that we love them, our partners that we’re on our way home for dinner, our managers that we’re running late for work, our friends that the last minute goal was definitely offside and here’s three reasons why… We’re actually writing more than ever. We’re constantly writing. And don’t get me started on the amount of reading that’s happening, that’s a whole other article. But when you take a moment to pause and really recognise how much we text message, WhatsApp, iMessage, you name it… each other, it starts to rack up. And so does the word count. And the thing is, 20 years ago, those moments of micro-communication; sharing information on an hourly basis; wouldn’t have been captured and therefore, wouldn’t have been written down. But if we can all be just a little more mindful with our texting, with our emailing… we can start to inject a layer of creativity into our craft; we can make every micro-writing moment a moment of writing practice. And that means hours and hours of writing practice have just been unlocked. Rotate your vocabulary, try new greetings, new sign offs; compose emails with length and elegance; explore advanced punctuation. Create a signature sign off for every text message but most importantly, just add some character. Concise creative writing is hard, it’s always been the hardest form of writing, expressing yourself in a handful of characters is a real challenge; so perfecting the text message is a very useful writing exercise to master.

On September 13th, we headed to the British Library in London to take part in a day of Data Visualisation workshops at the Alan Turing Institute. Data Visualisation has long been at the core of what we do, both within the Informatics Lab and in the Met Office as a whole. We were therefore interested to hear about some of the cutting edge projects emerging from leading data visualisation research. Fortunately, the workshop didn’t disappoint. During an afternoon of quick-fire talks, we were presented with some exciting implementations of data visualisation techniques, particularly in fields not considered ‘traditional’ for the subject. What follows is a quick summary of our thoughts from the day. First on the workshop bill at Turing was an introductory tutorial to the Tableau, a “business intelligence software that helps people see and understand their data.” Although an impressive piece of software, our primary takeaway was that it perhaps wasn’t suited to our needs. Here’s why: Pros: Cons: The highlight of the day was the collection of presentations on visualisation projects happening across the UK. It’s particularly good to see that visualisation is being integrated into a wide variety of different topics, and is being recognised as an important tool for data analysis and communication. Amongst the many interesting talks, we were particularly impressed by project Quill, a framework for modeling negotiated texts in an open and collaborative way. Data provenance, tagging and reusability is something we’ve spent some time exploring recently, and it appears that the team behind the project have worked toward solving a few of these shared problems. Other areas being explored included: Overall, I think our main takeaway from the day was acknowledging the value gained from communities of interest, such as that for data visualisation. Throughout the course of the day, it was interesting to identify areas of shared difficulties. Hearing how other organisations have overcome some of the challenges we’ve identified is a great development tool for our own research. -- -- The Met Office Informatics Lab combines scientists, technologists and designers working together to research, design and develop applications for environmental sciences.

The product and infrastructure is nuanced and one-of-a-kind. Building this product for scale has been an exercise in patience, creativity, remarkable engineering, laser physics, global logistics, and grit. The team is thoughtful, driven, and world-class. Our product is being deployed globally by some of the largest companies in the world. For example, we work with a technology company that uses Density to eliminate unauthorized access and tailgating; a hotel that measures their lounges in real-time so they can dynamically staff the area when usage spikes, a leading telecom proactively looking to better design tens of millions of square feet of their office space. We work with banks, government contractors, universities, energy companies, etc. What these customers have in common is space. Collectively they own, operate, and occupy billions of square feet of corporate real estate. As our profile in the industry has grown, we’ve started to hear from a remarkably long list of potential channel partners. These are some of the world’s largest service and systems providers: security and access control, architects, furniture companies, managed facilities, culinary, energy management, hospitality, etc. We’ve heard from hundreds of these firms. They’re all looking to partner. Until now, we did not have the resources to give these relationships the focus and support they deserve. However, they are a critical part of our distribution strategy and they require a thoughtful hand to support them. This would be your job. You can apply here. See below for a story about what we value. In the early years of the company, before doing what we’ve done, we still needed to build the business and learn from customers. To do so, we did some unorthodox things. Notably, we decided to support customers when our technology was barely ready. We gave them imperfect product knowing full well it would have been easier and less expensive to simply wait for production of our final design. This is a story of how we support our customers and what we value. It is also a letter to our future Head of Partnerships & Channel Sales. Early in Density’s life, our first customer had knowingly deployed prototype hardware. It was very-prototype. We called them “R56.” They were hand-soldered, large, and delicate. They were about the size of two Mac mini’s stacked on top of one another. To most people, they were ungainly things. To us they were a remarkable representation of future potential. After many years of work, it was the first time we were able to accurately count people without invading their privacy. It was also the first time we could show a customer what was possible. The handful of prototypes we deployed worked so well that our first customer asked to expand sooner than we were able to support. At the time, the final design of our production product wasn’t done. Our manufacturing line wasn’t operational. We had certifications we needed to work through, calibration issues, algorithm issues, supply chain issues, etc. And that was just the unit. Density is as much a software company as it is a maker of sensors. Our infrastructure is as nuanced as the device itself. Nevertheless, we still decided to support our customer. They had been singularly patient with us but as manufacturing timelines lengthened, we became concerned enthusiasm for working with Density would fall through if we didn’t meet expectations quickly. While engineering and operations raced to finish our manufacturing line, our customer-facing team set out to reconfigure the expensive, Mac-mini prototypes into a smaller, temporary solution that would just barely support an initial expansion. Over 9 weeks, the team ran a parallel, secondary program, hand-building 79 units without distracting engineering or hardware operations’ primary plan of record. After weeks of work and a dozen sleepless nights, they had managed to fit the same R56 components into a smaller enclosure and run a one-off batch they knew we would scrap when production product became available. Completed devices in hand and exhausted, the team flew to our customer and installed 79 units one-by-one, remaining onsite for more than 5 days to ensure the system was stable. These units were dubbed “R60.” This program, this approach to work, and the efforts of our customer-facing team led to one of the largest repeat customers we’ve ever had. They have grown 350% YoY, expanded nationally, and are now outfitting entire buildings with Density product. Long past are the days of hand-built stand-ins for product but we will still move mountains to support our customers. We invest ourselves in their success. We are honest and transparent. And as long as we have the capacity and cultural imperative, we will outwork their best vendor. Today, we are hiring someone to lead partnerships and channel sales. We are looking for someone who approaches business relationships with the same humility, thoughtfulness, and long-termism that we have valued since our founding.

I’m not sure when exactly, but the precise date is irrelevant. Once the horse was here, it was here to stay. As a dominant military, economic, transportation, and communications technology the horse quickly diffused through the continents in the same way goods are spread today: through trade; theft; loss and reclamation by new individuals; and so forth. It was adopted by new people for its utility. Many Americans are familiar with stereotypical Plains Indians adroitly astride horses acrobatically stalking buffalo or the 8th Cavalry, but any and all of the native tribes using horses would only have come to know the animal in the near past. And like many technologies, the horse eluded and escaped the control of people. There were no horses at all in the Americas before 1492, there were certainly no feral ones roaming wild in Montana. Horses took over. There was no stopping them. An intelligent machine is different than a horse. Somewhat. A horse, after all, is, to an extent, an intelligent machine. Like horses, artificial intelligence (AI) will disrupt our world only at a much faster and profound pace. Depending on how intelligent the machines become, they may, like horses, escape us as well. If mounted conquistadors overwhelmed Atahualpa’s and Montezuma’s warriors, what will it be like when intelligent systems — or the people who control them — run amok with our data? Control our electrical grids? Drive our cars? To an extent, such events are preordained. Some imagined applications of AI will be realized, others will not. Regulations and foresight will stop some malicious actors; others among the bad guys will find ways to manipulate and abuse the system. In the most fatalistic scenarios SkyNet takes over and we all live in the Matrix. I don’t know how smart AI will become, which elements of our lives it will revolutionize, or who — if anyone — will control it, for better or for worse. What I do know is that our economies, our world, our lives, are increasingly linked by an important yet delicate web of electronic and digital devices and mechanisms. Our data is everywhere, soon our DNA will be as well. AI systems already analyze this data, using it to tailor advertising as well as to learn. There’s no consensus on what exactly artificial intelligence means, let alone what it will become, but this cat is out of its bag. Before we fully understand it, AI systems will be incorporated into nearly every element of our lives. This doesn’t mean we should abdicate attempts to mitigate known risks, nor does it mean we should ignore future regulations when the time for them comes. But it means that our best efforts will ultimately come up short, and that’s if we’re able to put together the best effort. Are we able to summon the necessary academic, industry, military, and policy experts to define and inform, let alone build political consensus on AI-policy? Because as I type this AI systems are crunching data sets and piloting drones. The horse must be our lesson. It changed life on continents, but AI will change lives around the world. Even with the limits of our knowledge and the nascent state of the technology’s development, we would be wise to begin setting boundaries, guidelines, norms, and expectations for the safe and ethical application of AI. Inevitably such regulations will lag behind the technology and ultimately prove insufficient, but that is no excuse not to create an initial framework for this revolutionary emerging technology. In 1492, no one in the Americas knew the horse was arriving. This time, we’re more — if still inadequately — aware of what is on the horizon. It is time to act on AI. -- -- 1 empowerment through data, knowledge, and expertise. subscribe to DDIntel at https://ddintel.datadriveninvestor.com Career Educator.

Or maybe you’ve told your waiter you aren’t ready to order, but then don’t see them again for what feels like forever. What about that frustrating moment when your meal is done, the conversation has come to an end, and you’re ready to leave. And then.. BAM! You forgot to ask for the check. Then that check arrives and now you have to figure out who owes who what. Multiple credit cards? Cash? A combination of both? Venmo? We’ll circle back to these frustrations in a minute. People love restaurants. We’ve all gone out to eat. Restaurants are social landmarks — places where all sorts of emotions and conversations come to life. From date nights to business meetings, from family gatherings to networking events, from catching up with friends to getting that Happy Hour special, restaurants play an important role in all our lives. That’s why it’s no surprise that the restaurant industry’s projected sales for 2018 was $825 billion. People dine out more than ever before and it’s a beautiful thing. People’s love for restaurants empowered my grandmother to start her own, Babcha’s Pierogies, at 72 years old. Babcha’s Pierogies is your traditional sit-down restaurant, where guests are seated, orders are taken, food is served, and payment is transacted. We’ve dined this way since the 18th century. Today we have POS systems that help restaurants run more efficiently. But how efficient is it really? Here’s a rundown on the current process to order and pay at a sit-down restaurant: To order a meal, you communicate your order to the waiter, who then inputs your order into a machine (POS system), which relays your order to the kitchen. To pay for the meal, you notify the waiter, who goes to that same machine to print your check and deliver it to you. You provide either cash or credit, which the waiter takes back to the machine to process payment before returning back to you a second time. Finally, you leave a (hopefully generous) tip which requires the waiter to go back to the machine yet again. The reality of this process is quite clear — you’ll never not see a member of the waitstaff in front of the POS system during popular hours. While the waiter is running back and forth between your table and the POS system three times just to process payment, other people are waiting to order or pay as well. So what we’re getting at is this — restaurants are run inefficiently. This inefficiency leads to lost revenue for restaurants, who already face extremely tight margins. As for guests, this inefficiency leads to the frustrations outlined at the beginning of this post. Whereas we use our phones to pay for everything from Ubers to Airbnb’s to coffees at Starbucks to things on Amazon we really don’t need, we’re still painstakingly held back by the very traditional method of ordering and paying at sit-down restaurants. So what does TableTab do? We solve this pain, this two-sided inefficiency. When dining out, you can use our app to instantly pull up the restaurant’s menu, select which dish you want, and then order. Payment is done automatically. That’s it. We make ordering at restaurants as simple as ordering an Uber. We get payment done the very moment you place your order. No more having to wait to order or pay. You can leave as soon as you’re ready to go. No more having to calculate who owes who what or send Venmo requests — we eliminate that altogether. We save waitstaff hundreds of trips to the POS system and at the same time significantly increase their tip volume. We make modern dining at sit-down restaurants just that — modern. Guests get to control their dining experiences. Restaurants and waitstaff get to optimize their operations and make more money. It’s a win-win. Do you like eating out?

Powered by the breakthrough…  COTI Follow COTI -- Listen Share Today we are ticking off another milestone on our roadmap by releasing the first iteration of the COTI Payment Gateway. This initial release allows merchants to accept Bitcoin easily and directly via their websites and forms the first piece of our all-encompassing payment solution, the COTI Universal Payment Solution. Future releases of the COTI Payment Gateway will include support for Credit Cards, ETH, USDT, USDC and other popular cryptocurrencies (more to be announced on these VERY soon). The COTI Payment Gateway solution includes a “Pay with Crypto” button that is integrated via an easy to install the widget into the merchant’s website checkout page. Merchants are able to track and manage their crypto payments via access to their COTI Pay Business Merchant CRM. Merchants will receive payment in the sending currency via default (in this case Bitcoin), however via the Merchant CRM they can choose to convert the transaction to a stable coin or directly to one of 35 fiat currencies by adding in their bank account details. In the initial versions of the COTI Payment Gateway, all payments made via specific cryptocurrencies happen on each coin's actual chain, however, transactions are also mirrored on COTI’s Trustchain for future use on the COTI Universal Payment Solution and Global Trust System. In future versions of the COTI Payment Gateway, settlement will be instantaneous and not rely on any individual coins chain, as COTI-X, COTI’s internal settlement layer, will process the transaction on the Trustchain and instantly process both the transaction for the consumer, while setting the payment to the merchants account in the coin or fiat of their choice. This will allow a consumer to pay in Bitcoin without waiting for the confirmation times of the Bitcoin network and the merchant to instantly receive Bitcoin in their merchant account. To see our Crypto Payment Gateway in action, we’ve created a demo COTI store where you can purchase a personalised COTI image for $0.50c. Become an exclusive member of the COTI Club while seeing exactly how our Crypto Payment Gateway will work by trying it out yourself. How you see it on our demo store is exactly how it will work for our merchants, the first of which is set to go live in the very near future.

Before Arduino, any project that called for a microcontroller would require you to first wire up the components that are necessary just for it to run — and whatever you needed to program it. An Arduino lets you jump right in. But that’s a relatively recent advance, and Marek Więcek’s 6502 Retro Controller Board answers the question of what a 1970s Arduino would have looked like. This project started after Więcek found out that it’s possible to buy inexpensive MOS 6502 chips from Chinese auction sites. The 6502 was originally introduced in 1975, so Więcek was pleasantly surprised to find out that these are genuine working chips. That immediately inspired him to build an 8-bit retro computer based on the 6502 processor — a project which is still underway. While working on that, he decided it’d be interesting to build an Arduino-esque development board around the same 6502 processor. In keeping with the theme, Więcek decided he only wanted to use components that were available in the 6502’s heyday — or at least modern equivalents with the same functionality. Using those, along with a CMOS version of the 6502 (WDC65C02), Więcek set out to build his 6502 Retro Controller board with a custom PCB and some classic point-to-point wiring. That finished board has 8kB of RAM, 8kB of I/O addressable space, 8kB of EEPROM for config storage, an additional 8kB of EPROM for future use, and 32kB of main EPROM for the program and data. Więcek even built a shield with a HD44780 monochrome LCD display for readouts, and buttons for inputs. The finished product is a cool look at an alternate history where Arduino-like development boards were invented decades earlier. -- -- Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg"
https://codeburst.io/react-js-for-beginners-the-basics-87ef6e54dae7?source=tag_archive---------0-----------------------,React JS for Beginners — The Basics,What is a Library?,Cem Eygi,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cem Eygi Follow codeburst -- 9 Listen Share React JS is today's most popular JavaScript Library for building User Interfaces, which has created by Facebook. We can build modern, fast Single Page Applications or websites with React. As a Frontend Developer, I know that React JS is very popular among companies in the Software Industry, but we can also see the increase of React JS popularity in the last 5 years, by Google Trends: Since React is so popular in the market and beneficial to know for a Web/Frontend Developer, I decided to cover some features of React JS in my following articles, as 4 parts: If you are interested in learning more about programming, consider subscribing to my newsletter. This is one of the most unclear subjects of React. Let’s make this clear from the beginning. React is a Library, not a Framework. A library in programming can be explained as a collection of codes. We use a library to write code in a much simpler way or to import a feature from it into our project. JQuery is a library for example. We can write JavaScript much simpler by using JQuery, or we can import written JQuery features to our project. The project itself is not dependent on a library. A Framework, on the other hand, is a complete package of code with its own functionalities & libraries. A Framework has its own rules, you don’t have much flexibility and the project is dependent on the Framework you use. Angular is an example of a framework. So React is for building User Interfaces, and how you program the rest of the project is up to you. Like JQuery, you can include React in your project partially, or completely. So React JS a library. Now let’s move on with how React actually works… To understand the importance of React Virtual DOM, first, you need to know what DOM (Document Object Model) is. DOM is basically the representation of the HTML code in a webpage. The document is the webpage itself, the objects are the HTML tags. And finally, the model of DOM is a tree structure: You can read more about DOM here. Each time you make a change in the code, DOM will be completely updated and rewritten. This is an expensive operation and consumes lots of time. In this point, React provides a solution: The Virtual DOM. So when something changes: This approach makes a webpage much faster than a standard webpage. That’s also one of the reasons why React is so popular. In classic Frontend programming, we have separated HTML, CSS and JS file structures. React is a bit different. We don’t have separated HTML files in React. In JSX syntax, we write HTML tags inside JavaScript. Exactly :) In React, for example, a simple JavaScript variable can be like this: Normally, we can’t assign an HTML tag to a JavaScript variable. But with JSX, we can. The code above you see is neither HTML nor JavaScript. It’s an example of JSX. JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension to JavaScript used by React. JSX is basically used to write HTML tags inside JavaScript. Later, the JSX code will be translated into normal JavaScript, by Babel. In summary, React doesn’t have HTML files, HTML tags are rendered directly inside JavaScript. This approach makes React faster. You don’t have to use JSX with React, but it is strongly recommended. JSX simplifies React and makes it easier to read. Let me give an example of React code with and without JSX. React with JSX: Let me shortly explain the code here. We have a React class named “Hello”. This is a default React class with its render function. The class returns an HTML div element so it can be rendered later as a component, anywhere in your project. Below the class, there is a special React DOM Render function which is calling the Hello class, as a component (<Hello />) and specifies where (root) your React code will be printed. React without JSX: And here is the same React code as JavaScript but without JSX. Which one is easier for you? Some important rules about JSX: Finally, we follow the instructions below to install React: You can also see here for installation details. I hope that my article helps you to get the first understanding of React. React may seem complicated at the beginning but that’s OK.

Software developers use it all the time. We can not spend a day without interacting with Git. We can run Git from the terminal or use some third party tools like Sourcetree. But there are some terminal fans who always love to run Git from the terminal only. So for them, it is sometimes difficult to remember and write those long commands. Ohh no buddy!! It is very much a boring and time-consuming task to write long commands all the time 😭😭😭. So what should we do now??🤔 Okay, we should start looking for a shortcut for those long long commands.🏃‍🏃‍🏃‍ Look what we found: Git Alias. It has come as the rescuer for all. We all likely know what an alias is — it means a false name or nickname. So using git alias, we can assign a nickname to a long git command. This is perfect. 😍 Now let’s try to find a place where we can write these nicknames. Searching 🔍 Searching 🔍Searching 🔍… Yes, bash_profile is the place where we can write them. From Terminal, we can easily open bash_profile by using the following command: Now enter into insert mode in your vim editor by tapping i from the keyboard.✓ The first program we use to write in any programming language is a Hello World program. Let’s not break this tradition — we are going to write our very first alias with a simple hello command. Open bash_profile, and write the following line: It says that we have created an alias named hello and assigns the right-hand side as the command to execute. So whenever we write hello in the terminal, it should execute the command assigned to it. Save the changes and reload the bash_profile by using the following command: Now if we type hello in the terminal, it prints Hello Boudhayan!! How are you? Awesome!! 😎😎😎 So we have learned how to create an alias command in bash_profile. If we look closely, then we can relate to it. We can find some similarities with the variable declaration in any language. Yes, we already know about that, right? Now let’s create some git aliases to make our daily life easier and faster.🤘 We use this command for cloning a remote repository to a local system. Though it’s a short command, we want to start learning git aliases by making it even shorter.🤷‍ Just like above, open bash_profile, write the below line and reload bash_profile. See the magic.☄️ So from now on, for cloning a repository, we do not need to write this: instead, we will use the below command for cloning purposes: Boom!! Your remote repository is successfully cloned into your local system.👊👊👊 We push our local commits to the development or master branch by using the below commands: Now, we can write shorter version like below: So from now, we will use gpd and gpm to push local commits to the development and master branch respectively. 🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻 Hurrah!! We have made it.🕺🏻🕺🏻🕺🏻 I have created some more git aliases which can be really useful in our programming life. Check them out: We can also use the shell function to declare more complex git aliases. But to start with this, we need to know how to write a shell function.🧐 It is very easy to write a shell function which is like a normal C function.👍 Now let’s try this. This function will create a directory in the current path and then immediately move into that directory. We know the below commands already to make it happen: We can compress those two commands by creating a simple function in bash_profile like below: Now reload the bash_profile source once and run the following: It will create a directory named test in the current path and move to that directory. Cool!!😎 To push the code in the remote branch, we need to make a commit with some message. Only then we can push to a branch. So basically this is a combination of two commands (commit and push). But we want to try the same with a single one-line command by writing a shell function for this. 👆 We can easily do this by writing a simple shell function. Open bash_profile and write the following the function: Reload the bash_profile once and use the command like below: Cool!! From now we can use this gcp command to commit and push in one shot.😎 In a development or feature branch, all the team members push their changes almost every day. So sometimes it is very difficult to find a particular commit among all the commits. To easily handle this type of situation, we can write a function which will search the commit logs for a particular message and return the commit. To do this, we will write a function like below: Occasionally if we want to search for a commit by the commit message, then we can do it by using gfc: So we have learned how to use shortcuts for git commands. May these aliases and functions save you from writing those long git commands and make your life easy and smooth. You can add your own aliases, functions and make modifications to them — no one’s permission is required except bash.😉😉😉 🙏🙏🙏 Cheers!!!

https://medium.com/@reachfund/reachs-new-investment-theses-11985a385f51?source=tag_archive---------13-----------------------,Reach’s New Investment Thesis,Published in Reach Capital,Reach Capital,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Reach Capital Follow Reach Capital -- Listen Share by Esteban Sosnik Reach invests in people and solutions that broaden access to quality education. Through our investments, we aim to inspire and empower learners at every stage of life. We do this by backing education technology products that are grounded in strong pedagogy and research, delivered in engaging formats and designed to be human-centric. No longer confined to formal schooling, education is now recognized as a life-long endeavor and critical to a shifting economy. As such, technology is playing an increasingly important role in expanding access to new learning opportunities and communities. Massive global businesses are being built with learners all over the world who are seeking to enrich their lives and initiate new economic opportunities. Given changes to the macro environment, we periodically step back to analyze how the market is evolving and identify new and exciting areas for investment. When the Reach team began investing in edtech, we were primarily focused on companies developing products for K-12 schools. At the time, laptops and iPads were just making their way into classrooms, and schools were increasingly connected to the Internet. We invested primarily in teacher-focused products such as ClassDojo, Nearpod and Newsela- companies that have transformed parent communication and instruction. Many of the products we funded are now commonplace in US schools and touch millions of kids and teachers. Over the years, we’ve expanded our investment scope more intentionally into higher education and lifelong learning while always sticking to our core principles of strong pedagogy, research-driven and human-focused education. Leveraging our investment experience, we’ve identified two new areas that align with our mission and represent promising market opportunities for the coming years: Career Pathways and Learning Enablers. Our career pathways thesis focuses on solutions that develop “employability” skills that are in demand today. These include both hard and soft skills that bridge the gap between what students have traditionally learned in formal education and what employers and the labor market demand. We are moving away from an education system focused on credentials to one focused on higher-level skills and mindsets. As automation continues to penetrate more industries, the demands of jobs are changing at increasingly faster rates and employers are shifting to valuing skills over degrees. And because technology is driving an unprecedented pace of change, continuous learning is imperative to stay relevant in the workforce. The stakeholders with the greatest motivation to facilitate this shift include employers desperate to hire and retain valuable workers and job seekers in need of new skills. Millennials, for example, have much higher expectations for professional growth, generating a titanic shift in how companies design and invest in training and employee development. At the same time, the digital skills gap is a byproduct of software eating the world, spawning an explosion of workforce development programs. With millions of unfulfilled job positions across industries resulting from a fast-moving economy, reskilling the workforce at scale is a clear opportunity for new business creation. Higher education institutions, traditionally focused on preparing young adults for the world ahead, play a critical role here too. With the current $1.5T college debt crisis, the slower pace of enrollment and an increasingly diverse demographic, higher education institutions are already feeling the pressure to prove their relevance and value to students. Even K-12 is showing signs of change in this direction with a renewed focus on STEAM and the 4Cs (critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity) and a record high demand for social emotional learning in schools. Given this context, we are focused on companies that are addressing this opportunity across K12, higher-ed and workforce development. Learners’ expectations from K12 through adulthood focus on training in skill areas demanded by employers. For too long education institutions and industry have worked in silos with little to no communication. We believe the future is bright for those who can work with industry to guarantee job advancement and hence make new education offerings the lifeblood of employment in the 21st century. We believe that technology can be used to scale the delivery of supports and interventions that improve students’ ability to learn. This type of support has historically been high-touch and expensive to deliver. As a result, these critical supports have been limited, often just scratching the surface of demand. Examples of these supports include guidance counselors, specialists for students with learning differences, tutoring and health aides. The corporate sector has L&D, line managers and executive coaches to support the learning and advancement of employees. Technology can be used to super-power the humans that do this work. By affordably engaging human resources to provide support, and by targeting proven interventions, we now have the ability to scale these supports. These approaches can be applied to academic support and other critical areas for student success, such as career readiness, financial aid and mental health. Live video chat and mobile penetration can reduce the costs of connecting students with experts anywhere, anytime. Machine learning can help efficiently deploy a portfolio of supports at scale by detecting and predicting students’ needs and targeting the delivery of proven, effective supports. We’re just starting to see university functions such as enrollment, student success, and career centers being transformed with the help of technology. We believe that the ability to provide access to student support will be critical to the success of learners at scale in the 21st century. The winners will be those companies supporting students where they are (increasingly on-the-go), and paving the way for them to achieve their learning goals. We are excited for the coming years of investing in edtech and for the iconic companies that will be created in these two areas and beyond. We believe that education is the most important investment for the world economy as it represents the real lever for the future of work: augmenting human potential in the face of automation and talent competition.

Because it is done illegally, this action is also automatically carried out anonymously. This is done by creating fake accounts that also contain false data. This method is deliberately done so that users can not report their crime formally. The description of the level of technological sophistication that we see today, basically has good and bad effects. Therefore, as a millennial generation that is literate in technology is expected to not be too immersed in the world of sophistication. If during this time we are given the ease to access something, then we must also have knowledge on how to maintain the stability of the access. Lots of software security systems on the market, but it would be the same if as users we can only see without observing and integrating them. All software security systems are designed to meet all kinds of criteria that users need. The question is, if the user is someone who has a very high level of mobility and also has large-scale projects. Will the user use an ordinary security system? Then the right answer is no. Because if this happens there will be an imbalance. If we compare the high-scale data or project requirements, it must also be protected by a reliable security system. Therefore currently Blocksafe has been present to meet all the criteria given by the user. If some security systems can only be accessed via a desktop screen, then by integrating the Blocksafe system you can also access them via a smartphone. The Blocksafe security system is also called the Cryptodefender. Cryptodefender on the desktop screen has a military grade encryption system. Because of military class, this is of course also followed by cryptodefender found on smart phones. The AES-256 encryption system found on a smartphone is capable of storing user’s personal data stored in a safe by accessing via fingerprint. Each letter that is typed will automatically be encrypted by the Blocksafe system, so this can narrow down the attacker’s motion on various occasions. Did you know that at this time the attackers have a thousand kinds of tactics that will be done to be able to penetrate the security layer on a security system designed by the platform. Currently the main method carried out by the attackers is to create a software program designed to damage the entire operating system platform. This program is usually called Malware, which each malware has a different workmanship effect. This working effect can turn off the operating system slowly or can turn it off suddenly too. This of course depends on the security layer provided on the platform. Therefore currently Blocksafe does not only provide multiple layers of security. But the team of experts also always work together to always renew the existing security system. This was done because the teams realized that the more sophisticated a system was, the greater the attackers’ desire to solve it. Therefore if the expert team does not always monitor and observe closely it is not impossible that undesirable things will happen. In addition to preventing illegal data retrieval, cryptodefender contained in the smartphone system is also able to prevent the automatic storage of data from Malware. Even if users are confused and feel unsure of the password that has been created. So Blocksafe also features a Secure Password Generator that can provide and store passwords securely. Although it has a different name, but all the features possessed by Blocksafe, both for desktop screens and smart phones basically have the same function. For example with the Anti Screen Capture feature that has a function to prevent attackers from capturing desktop screens that contain important data. Similarly, smartphone crytodefender automatically encrypts important data even when the data is typed. It would be useless if the attackers were able to capture the smartphone monitor screen, but no more data could be seen. It is not easy to bring a security system to two different systems. Because automatically experts must also divide the concentration between the two systems. Maybe as users we will see how practical the Blocksafe operating system is. But behind it all there are teams that always work together to embody the real stability of security. Because the quality of a platform is not only seen from the level of sophistication, but also how it can maintain stability despite the many threats that come.

https://medium.com/@mattmattizme/why-public-conversations-suck-in-america-721e7be8ceb4?source=tag_archive---------151-----------------------,How Television Shaped Public Conversations in the U.S.,Notes from Neil Postman’s Amusing Ourselves to Death,matt m,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in matt m Follow -- Listen Share “Television is our culture’s principle mode of knowing about itself. Therefore — and this is the critical point — how television stages the world becomes the model for how the world is properly to be staged. It is not merely that on the television screen entertainment is the metaphor for all discourse. It is that off the screen the same metaphor prevails.” Despite being published in 1985, Neil Postman’s Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business is still deeply relevant to our present media environment. The book’s relevance stems from the fact that Postman clearly articulates two problems that we are still dealing with: In order to further understand those problems, Postman wrote that his argument: “… fixes its attention on the forms of human conversation, and postulates that how we are obliged to conduct such conversations will have the strongest possible influence on what ideas we can conveniently express. And what ideas are convenient to express inevitably become the important content of a culture.” Basically, it’s a restatement of Marshal McLuhan’s famous line “the medium is the message”. How we communicate — that is, the technologies and mediums we use — can “regulate and even dictate” what we can communicate. For example, smoke signals among the Cherokee people. This ingenious form of communication was perfectly suited for sending long-distance messages about safety or danger. However, if you tried to send a philosophical message or talk about economics with smoke signals, you would fail. “Its form excludes the content,” as Postman wrote. Applied to TV, what content does the form of TV exclude? The public conversations informed by daily newspapers before the telegraph and TV were more relevant, meaningful, serious, and functional than the public conversations informed by the news after the telegraph and TV. Why? America was founded by intellectuals. Let that sink in. Although both women and enslaved people were restricted or banned from reading in early colonial America, the literacy rate among white males was high. (brief note: the fact that women and enslaved people had restrictions or outright bans on their ability to read books is horrendous. Also, it’s a testament to the powerful effects of reading — the rulers feared that a well-read public would be a threat to them. “Knowledge is power,” as the saying goes. With that caveat in mind, it’s important to note that among white males, both rich and poor could and did read. In that restricted sense, things were pretty equal: there was no “literary aristocracy” as there was in many parts of Europe. In Amusing Ourselves to Death, Postman writes that the male literacy rate in 1650 was about 60% and rose to 90% by 1795. By the time of the telegraph around 1840, it was between 91–97%. It wasn’t all bibles either. During 1776, Thomas Pain’s book Common Sense sold 100,000 copies in a country of 2.5 million people — in other words, 1 out of every 25 people had a copy. In 1835, there were about 3,000 lectures halls spanning 15 states where people went to hear and engage with ideas. People expected those ideas to be presented in a way that explained their historical development, embedded them in a present context, and unfolded in a linear sequence. In the Great Debates of 1858, Abraham Lincoln and Stephan Douglas debated seven times in halls around Illinois to see who would become senator. Rather than soundbite ideas, the structure went like this: As Neil Postman writes: “For two centuries, America declared its intentions, expressed its ideology, designed its laws, sold its products, created its literature and addressed its deities with black squiggles on white paper. It did its talking in typography, and with that as the main feature of its symbolic environment rose to prominence in world civilization. The name I give to that period of time during which the American mind submitted itself to the sovereignty of the printing press is the Age of Exposition. Exposition is a mode of thought, a method of learning, and a means of expression. Almost all of the characteristics we associate with mature discourse were amplified by typography, which has the strongest possible bias toward exposition: a sophisticated ability to think conceptually, deductively and sequentially; a high valuation of reason and order; an abhorrence of contradiction; a large capacity for detachment and objectivity; and a tolerance for delayed response.” This “mature discourse” with the “strongest possible bias” toward thinking “conceptually, deductively, and sequentially” changes forever in 1840 with the arrival of the telegraph. The problem that the telegraph solved was the problem of space. The problem with solving the problem of space was that it led to the problem of too much information. Lots of irrelevant information came through. Henry David Thoreau understood this when, in Walden, he wrote of the desire to: “…tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the Old World some weeks nearer to the New, but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad, flapping American ear will be that the Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.” Before the telegraph, the information that made up “the news” moved at the speed of rail — about 35 mph. This meant that (most) information was more grounded in the lived experience of the local readership. For a democracy, this was pretty useful because people had region-specific conversations that addressed their own region-specific interests and needs. Let’s not overly romanticize it though — it had major problems and could lead to small-town thinking and bigotry. However, it did have one major benefit: what counted as news was highly functional and relevant to the democratic readers meant to be informed and guided by it. After the telegraph, information went from moving at the speed of rail to moving at the speed of light. A continent-wide conversation could emerge, but what would the content of that conversation be? Postman was skeptical that it would be any good because: “The principle strength of the telegraph was its capacity to move information, not collect it, explain it or analyze it.” The information that moved was often sensationalistic headlines and fragments that stormed in to drown us in “news from nowhere, addressed to no one in particular”. The reader came to know of many things, but knew very little about them. News-as-Functional-Information became News-as-NonFunctional-Curiosity. It became just another commodity in a “decontextualized information environment”. As Postman writes: “The telegraph made a three-pronged attack on typography’s definition of discourse, introducing on a large scale irrelevance, impotence, and incoherence. These demons of discourse were aroused by the fact that telegraphy gave a form of legitimacy to the idea of context-free information; that is, to the idea that the value of information need not be tied to any function it might serve in social and political decision-making and action, but may attach merely to its novelty, interest, and curiosity. The telegraph made information into a commodity, a ‘thing’ that could be bought and sold irrespective of its uses or meaning.” Starting with the telegraph and growing with television, the gap between information and action widened. Fact grew distant from Value as we began to define the value of facts by their entertainment appeal rather than any role they served “in social and political decision-making and action”. It became more difficult to find any meaning and relevance in the disorganized chaos of context-free performances that the television streamed into our lives. TV remade the world into a nonlinear series of “And Now This. And Now This. And Now This.” segments that all had to be entertaining. Not all ideas can or should fit the narrow demands of this form of communication. Not everything should be recast as televised entertainment. As Postman writes: “The problem is not that television presents us with entertaining subject matter but that all subject matter is presented as entertaining, which is another issue altogether. To say it still another way: Entertainment is the supra ideology of all discourse on television. No matter what is depicted or from what point of view, the overarching presumption is that it is there for our amusement and pleasure.” Television worsened public conversations in America because TV gave the fullest expression to the biases of the telegram and the biases of the photograph. In getting news and conversation from nowhere meant for no-one in particular, we got news and conversations told through sensationalistic fragments and context-free images that only required us to recognize what was depicted, not understand what it meant. When too much information is presented without sequence and without context, it is difficult to determine how meaningful it is, how relevant it is, and what you should do about it. In short, the information-action ratio is too wide. So, how do we narrow the gap? The first step is to realize that there is a gap and to understand that knowledge as told by printed books differs from knowledge as told by TV, which differs from knowledge as told by social media. Each medium has structural biases that regulate and dictate the messages that can be told. Why did Steve Jobs strictly regulate his kids’s use of technology? One reason is that he valued the kind of thinking that gets fostered through reading books. When Jobs and his family had dinner, they would have long and complex conversations about the ideas embedded in important books. The second step is to read more. Read Great Books, not The Great Books, but Great Books. Ones that are the distilled result of years of study and reflection. Quality of thought should be the litmus test. Yes, they might be complicated, but quality in anything — from cooking to thinking — takes care and attention. The form of Great Books always includes that message. -- -- Intellectual wanderlust from a nomadic book fiend. From the USA. Based elsewhere.

Quando se fala de Blockchain uma pergunta que aparece frequentemente é se essa tecnologia ira aposentar os cartórios. Pelo fato de que com ela as informações poderão ser visualizadas mais rápidas de forma mais prática sem precisar fazer filas ou passar por toda a burocracia dos cartórios atualmente. A principio não creio que os cartórios serão substituídos mas sim passarão por mudanças que irão atualizar eles. Os cartórios aplicando a tecnologia Blockchain neles irão facilitar seus processos tornando os mais práticos e rápidos e descentralizando as informações, por exemplo as pessoas não precisarão mais ir a um cartório retirar alguma certidão eles poderão simplesmente acessar pelo computador. Assim sendo os cartórios podem melhorar fazendo com que os problemas atuais que eles possuam sejam resolvidos com Blockchain , de modo que retirar certificados ,autenticar documento sejam mais rápidos não precisando fazer filas e perder horas nela e o custo desses serviços possam ficar mais baratos. Em alguns municípios do Brasil como Pelotas e Morro Redondo alguns escritórios de registradores já estão adotando a tecnologia Blockchain visando acabar com os registro em papeis e como se trata dessa tecnologia as informações não estarão suscetíveis a roubo ,alteração,fraude ou dano.

A decade before, almost everyone use monolithic structure to run their e-commerce portals. And Monolithic has its own advantages like: But in today’s era and at a reasonable scale, micro-services makes more sense. Because: In spite of all the above advantages, it is not easy to do the transitions. Because there are some real questions before the final decision: 95% of the organizations will have the above questions and constraints. So what shall be done? Shall the technology developments keep moving on the tortoise speed? or Shall there be a separate team to change the whole system? What is that which can balance both the worlds? The only way we figured out to move ahead by addressing the user experience pain points or response time pains and new use cases which will give the best benefit to technology stack, user experience as well as business. This approach gives time to everyone, from developers to leadership teams, to understand and measure the impacts it brings in the products as well as business. In a monolithic system, how should one get what is the top priority thing? The one which does the biggest harm in user experience? Finding this is easy with help of APM tools, because these are the ones which makes your application monitoring very easy. These tools tells you the exact line of the code in application or a query in the DB which is causing the issue. Top APM tools can be found at: https://www.imobdevtech.com/Blog/list-of-top-10-application-performance-monitoring-tools/ In our case the top priority issues which impacted user experience were due to Inefficient Caching (having multiple Memcached locks during each user request) and third party interactions .Some of them third party interaction scenario’s are given below: Considering above observations it made sense to have a Micro-service. Since other monolithic products in the company also had the same issue, soon all the teams started using the one service for all third party interactions. We finally got our first micro-service service in node.js which looked like below. Since each product gave the task to this service. All threads started getting released immediately from the application server and maintained a good response and the user experience. We launched multiple micro services after the first one and some are still in progress. Majority of services came up because of the use cases to reduce the development efforts, to chose the apt technical stack ,reworks in different products and to reduce complexities in monolithic structure.

In fact, the idea of obsoleting myself has been my goal ever since I started managing people years ago. Because only when you obsolete yourself can you effectively delegate. Huh? Now why would you want to make yourself not needed anymore? And what does this have to do with delegating to your team? The concept of obsoleting yourself is somewhat of a leap of faith. You are betting that there will be higher-level work you can do by having your team be able to do the work. You’re also betting that you’ll gain significant leverage by effectively delegating. As CEO, you have to be thinking about how you get your team to do as much as possible. In fact, your goal should be that the company runs perfectly if you are not involved. There are two very practical reasons you want to work hard to delegate to your team: The true sign of an effective manager is when you take yourself out of the picture.

People who are interested in creating a unique marketing strategy for themselves will probably take advantage of terms like blockchain, artificial intelligence, and big data. These common words make it easy for them to sell products or services that really don’t have anything new or that don’t really exist. Because there is so much false information is rising, C-Suite executives are very skeptical about new technology and are reluctantly embracing more modern solutions for old problems. To better understand the value of blockchain, leaders must understand several truths regarding some common misconceptions in the following: While blockchain is essential for how cryptocurrency works, its value has nothing related to Bitcoin. At its core, blockchain is a secure and decentralized solution for storing digital records. A blockchain contains different data “blocks”, connected to other blocks using cryptography, creating a chain of information stored on multiple computers. What makes blockchain highly evaluated compared to traditional business journaling methods is its transparency and immutability. It cannot be intervented or changeable, and every block has access and allows a view. Block protection creates a clear and complete line of responsibilities, useful in many ways rather than just making money. Because services like SQL Server and Oracle cover areas similar to blockchain, some argue that it will be a replacement for more traditional relational databases. However, the main blockchain platform is still in its infancy and has no intention of replacing entrenched solutions. Blockchain exists in numerous of relational options While it is true, the blockchain has allowed Bitcoin to remove intermediaries from its transactions, but it is not the case in other applications. As long as transactions still remain within an internal ecosystem, they will not require external confirmation. However, when it comes to interacting with the global in general, intermediaries can still support data authentication and identity verification. The big advantage of many blockchain projects is the public nature of each transaction. This transparency has led many businesses to believe that blockchain can only exist in a public setting — or creating a permission-based application is not possible. Meanwhile, the most current blockchain is not necessarily opened for everyone to join. They may be restricted to only those who need to know certain information. Like any new technology, the success or failure of adopting blockchain technology depends on their application. Executives need to look thoroughly at marketing jargon and flashy promises that make blockchain look like a mess of technology. Instead, they have to find their own core goals — and then decide whether blockchain can help them achieve those goals faster. Did you feel clear about blockchain after reading the article above?

This blockchain-based digital platform provides services in the form of telecommunication network reliability through a SIM card that can be used in all countries in the world. Miracle Tele SIM card network reaches international reach with affordable service prices. They also reduce the overall complexity of the bureaucracy in obtaining this SIM card. As the name suggests, this card provides its own magic to all customers of telecommunications operators. Every group that often travels from one place to another will be greatly facilitated by the presence of this Miracle Tele service. communication can now be done from anywhere without the need to worry about the cost of expensive bills even though this platform applies the payment concept “Pay As You Go”. Every telecommunications service provided can be assured that it will not drain the user’s pocket. This platform was first established in the first quarter of 2018 by a blockchain technology expert graduating from the University of Latvia’s political science department named Burciks Andrejk. He who is the CEO of this platform is slowly building Miracle Tele after spending years learning about blockchain technology. His great interest in this field has made him slowly make him leave the world of political science and then plunge into business. In this period of business development, Andrejk also studied technology to collaborate with the business he runs. The mission of his life is to make a difference and solve complex problems with efficient solutions. This mission finally brought Andrejk together with several of his colleagues in a team starting the Miracle Tele platform development project. This project has become a big thing that happened in his life where his ambition was to bring meaningful changes in the telecommunications industry and people’s lives through technology that is currently developing. Some of the team partners who contributed to building this platform included Zia Word (CMO), Aleksandar Djordjevic (CTO), Sagar Bansal (CCO), Roman Golod (Head of Development), Mafalda Pinto (Head of Customer Support), Joshua Woods (Researcher), Ilya Bolshakov (CBDO), Veronica Müller (Office & Event Manager), Evelyn Hofstetter (ICO Legal Adviser), Thomas Contin (ICO Legal Adviser), and Michael Conn (Adviser). During its journey from 2018 to the present, Miracle Tele has managed to realize half of their planning. At the beginning of its development, Miracle Tele formed a core team consisting of a number of experts mentioned earlier and launched their website. This platform has finished building their blockchain technology network infrastructure and is ready to be forwarded to the operation testing phase. At the same time, Miracle Tele has prepared all the basic concepts and provisions regarding this platform as a whole which are written in their white documents or whitepapers. in the second quarter of 2018, Miracle Tele has shown better development where this platform has been officially registered in the Czech Republic as a company operating there. They helped open the main headquarters in Prague as a location that would support their operations. Mircale Tele has also successfully entered into a contract with a cellular telecommunications service provider that was signed while launching a SIM card that can function in 163 countries. In the same year in the third quarter, Miracle Tele focused on developing an operating system on mobile phones by launching an Android-based application. The achievement achieved at this time was to successfully gather more than 5,000 users of their telecommunications network. They obtained the MVNO license from the Czech Telecommunications Authority and they have completed testing the prize model using the TELE token. In the last quarter of 2018, Miracle Tele has developed their network by launching an iOS version of the application. The performance of the telecommunications system is enhanced by improving the performance of the APN server side equipment. They held negotiations with cellular operators to collaborate and complete infrastructure development to facilitate the payment of their telecommunications services using TELE tokens. At this stage, Miracle has succeeded in increasing the number of users of their services to reach 8,000 users, of which there were only 5,000 users. Currently, in 2019 during January to March, Miracle Tele has officially announced that TELE tokens can already be used to pay for telecommunications services used by each user group. Mircale Tele once again made an achievement by reaching 50 thousand registered users on their network. Their next target is to develop an exclusive digital wallet to facilitate the storage of users’ digital assets and activate the use of WhatsApp and Telegram social media applications using the Miracle Tele SIM card. Through careful planning and appropriate efforts, Miracle Tele predicts being able to reach 25 thousand active users on their network services until the end of the first quarter.

AMA đầu tiên trên Telegram có sự tham gia của CEO và người đồng sáng lập của Travala — Matt Luczynski. Cuộc phỏng vấn được tổ chức bởi Songping Que của NGD, Luczynski đã trả lời các câu hỏi từ cộng đồng NEO về một loạt các chủ đề, bao gồm các kế hoạch cho một website beta mới, ứng dụng di động và kế hoạch của nhóm cho các nỗ lực marketing trong tương lai. Luczynski nhấn mạnh về sự ưu thế hiện tại của Travala với tư cách là một đại lý du lịch trực tuyến trong ngành công nghiệp blockchain và đưa ra những hiểu biết sâu sắc về các bước tiếp theo trong sự phát triển của nền tảng này. Bạn có đọc cuộc phỏng vấn giữa NEO LIVE với Travala đầy đủ bên dưới. Ngoài ra, bản gốc cuộc phỏng vấn này có thể được xem trực tiếp trên kênh telegram chính thức của NEO. Host: Khách mời đầu tiên của chúng tôi cho NEO LIVE là Matt Luczynski — CEO và đồng sáng lập của Travala.com. Là một doanh nhân có kinh nghiệm dày dặn về marketing và công nghệ, Matthew là một người kỳ cựu trong ngành du lịch, đã làm việc cho một số công ty khởi nghiệp táo bạo trong ngành. Được thúc đẩy bởi mục tiêu áp dụng blockchain trong thế giới thực, ông đã đồng sáng lập Travala.com — một hệ sinh thái du lịch tận dụng nền kinh tế token để cung cấp cho người tiêu dùng một nền tảng công bằng, đáng tin cậy và minh bạch. Ngoài ra, Matthew cũng là người sáng lập ứng dụng Wanderlust, một ứng dụng du lịch để gặp gỡ dựa trên địa điểm được thiết kế để người dùng kết nối với nhau dựa trên sở thích cụ thể của họ. Hỏi: Xin chào Matt, câu hỏi đầu tiên, khi nào Travala sẽ đến với Binance, bên bạn có kế hoạch gì không? Đáp: Niêm yết trên sàn giao dịch là một điều mà doanh nghiệp chúng tôi không thể thảo luận do NDA (Thỏa thuận không tiết lộ thông tin) mà chúng tôi đã ký. Chúng tôi cũng hướng đến việc tiếp tục thúc đẩy trong tất cả các lĩnh vực để làm cho AVA dễ tiếp cận hơn với tất cả người dùng để sử dụng trên nền tảng Travala.com. Hỏi: Chúng tôi có thể mong đợi sẽ có 15 nhà cung cấp tích hợp trước ngày 15/8 không? Đáp: Chúng tôi hiện đã kết nối với tổng cộng 17 nhà cung cấp thông qua đối tác công nghệ của chúng tôi. Điều này sẽ mang lại cho Travala.com hơn 1,5 triệu bất động sản trên toàn thế giới. Chúng tôi hiện đang trải qua các giai đoạn chứng nhận với tất cả các nhà cung cấp và một khi chúng tôi vượt qua, chúng tôi sẽ đi vào hoạt động. Điều này sẽ diễn ra ở mức độ nào đó trong tháng Tám. Hỏi: Tại sao tôi nên sử dụng Travala thay vì Orbitz hay các trang web du lịch phổ biến khác? Đáp: Giá — Giá của chúng tôi trung bình rẻ hơn 15% so với các trang web du lịch khác cũng như các đối thủ cạnh tranh trong ngành truyền thống. Kế hoạch kinh doanh của chúng tôi tập trung vào điều này khi chúng tôi hình thành một mô hình đột phá nhắm đến mục tiêu sự ứng dụng của người tiêu dùng. Phòng trống — Chúng tôi có một nguồn cung lớn các khách sạn và chỗ ở tại 210 quốc gia khác nhau và sẽ tăng lên hơn nữa khi chúng tôi tung ra các bản cập nhật trong tương lai. Chương trình phần thưởng Trung thành (SMART) — Bạn kiếm được AVA cho mỗi lần bạn thực hiện đặt phòng. Giảm giá SMART — Nắm giữ AVA để tiếp cận với mức giảm giá lên tới 10% trên giá vốn đã thấp của chúng tôi. Tiết kiệm hơn nữa khi đặt phòng. Truy cập với nhiều loại tiền điện tử và tiền pháp định. Hỏi: Xin chào Matt, tôi nghĩ khi phiên bản beta được phát hành, Travala có thể mong đợi sự gia tăng số lượng đặt phòng. Bạn có đang cân nhắc thuê thêm người cho dịch vụ khách hàng trước hay xung quanh khoảng thời gian đó không? Đáp: Với việc phát triển UX / UI cùng với nhiều nguồn cung có sẵn hơn, chúng tôi hy vọng nền tảng sẽ duy trì sự tăng trưởng như chúng ta đã thấy trong 7 tháng qua. Hỏi: Những lợi ích dành cho người giữ token của Travala là gì? Đáp: AVA là cửa ngõ để nhận được giảm giá và nhiều phần thưởng hơn nữa trên nền tảng travala.com. Bạn có thể đọc thêm về nó ở đây — https://blog.travala.com/use-case-for-the-ava-token/ Hỏi: Token AVA có thể được mua trực tiếp trên trang web Travala không? Hay một bên thứ ba sẽ xử lý việc này? Bạn có kế hoạch nào cho cổng tiền pháp định hay không? Có phải Nash sẽ chịu trách nhiệm về này? Đáp: Chúng tôi đang chờ xem hệ thống Nash sẽ hoạt động như thế nào, cũng có những vấn đề pháp lý xung quanh việc cung cấp AVA mua trực tiếp thông qua nền tảng. Tất cả những điều chúng tôi đang xem xét phát triển đều là để giúp mọi người tham gia chương trình Travala Smart trên nền tảng này dễ dàng hơn. Hỏi: Trước hết xin chúc mừng Matt vì đã gây quỹ thành công trên Crowdcube, câu hỏi của tôi là khi nào chúng ta sẽ thấy ứng dụng Travala trên cả hai nền tảng, một ứng dụng dễ sử dụng và thân thiện hơn khi so sánh với trang web sao cho khung thời gian gần đúng? Đáp: Cảm ơn bạn, đó là một khoảnh khắc tuyệt vời khi chúng tôi hoàn thành một cách thành công việc gây quỹ cộng đồng, điều mà tôi luôn muốn hoàn thành. Việc phát triển ứng dụng di động sẽ bắt đầu vào tháng 10 năm nay. Hỏi: Bạn sẽ đặt Travala tại một số điểm trên Kayak hay kế hoạch này đã bị hủy? Đáp: Chúng tôi vẫn đang mở các cuộc thảo luận với Kayak và các nền tảng khác với mô hình tương tự. Có thể việc này không diễn ra ngay nhưng vẫn nằm trong mục tiêu của chúng tôi. Hỏi: Tầm nhìn của bạn cho Travala cho đến cuối năm 2020 và sau đó là gì? Đáp: Sự phát triển. Chúng tôi muốn có nhiều đơn đặt chỗ hơn và thống trị trong ngành tiền điện tử về mảng đặt chỗ du lịch (điều mà chúng tôi đang làm). Cùng với điều này, chúng tôi sẽ bắt đầu xúc tiến vào thị trường chính. Hỏi: Xin chào Matt! Bạn có thể nói về mục tiêu của bạn trong tương lai về thị phần không? Đáp: Bạn có thấy việc có được 0,1–1% thị phần của những gã khổng lồ hiện tại như Booking.com, Hotels.com là một mục tiêu thực tế không? Mục tiêu của chúng tôi là đạt được 1% thị phần vào năm 2023. Người ta nói rằng khó có thể dự đoán ở giai đoạn đầu này do sự tăng trưởng ước tính của tổng thị trường du lịch trực tuyến. Trong lĩnh vực tiền điện tử, chúng tôi dự đoán sẽ duy trì sự thống trị của mình. Hỏi: Cùng với bản cập nhật vào tháng 8, các cải tiến để tìm kiếm cũng sẽ được áp dụng, để dễ dàng xác định vị trí các quốc gia, v.v …không? Hiện tại rất khó tìm thấy tất cả các địa điểm ở Maldives, tôi lấy ví dụ. Đáp: Có, chúng tôi liên tục điều chỉnh và cập nhật các cải tiến tìm kiếm trên trang web. Chúng tôi hiểu vấn đề bạn đang đề cập và đang thực hiện các thay đổi cho các bản cập nhật trong tương lai. Hỏi: Có những cách nào khác (ngoài phần thưởng SMART) đã được triển khai để khuyến khích việc sử dụng AVA trên nền tảng thay vì nhiều tùy chọn thanh toán khác? Đáp: Phần thưởng, giảm giá, giới thiệu, thanh toán và đánh giá. Các mục khác sẽ được thêm vào khi nền tảng phát triển. Hỏi: Bạn có thể giải thích rõ hơn về những người có sức ảnh hưởng (Key opinion leaders) không? Đây có phải là một chương trình marketing liên kết ngoài phần thưởng 20$ cho việc mời bạn bè? Đáp: Đúng vậy, chúng tôi có một chương trình đối tác duy nhất mà chúng tôi đã bắt đầu triển khai. Ví dụ, bitcoin.com và nền tảng Litecoin đã tham gia với chúng tôi. Hỏi: Travala đã chấp nhận một số loại tiền điện tử như một phương tiện thanh toán. Bạn có kế hoạch để thêm GAS tại một số điểm không? Đáp: Chúng tôi đang xem xét điều này khi chúng tôi nói chuyện về quan hệ đối tác và sự hợp tác với NEO. Hỏi: Khi nào trang web beta sẽ được phát hành? Đáp: Beta sẽ là phiên bản được tung ra liên tục và không phải là bản cập nhật một lần. Bản cập nhật đầu tiên sẽ vào tháng Tám. Hỏi: Khi nào chương trình hoàn trả cho đánh giá sẽ được đưa ra và dự kiến về % số người thực hiện đánh giá so với tổng số lượt đặt chỗ là bao nhiêu? Đáp: Dự đoán vào đầu quý 1 năm 2020. Ước tính từ 0,5–1% trên tổng giá trị đặt phòng. Điều này có thể thay đổi và chưa được thiết lập. Hỏi: ⅓ các đánh giá có thể được coi là giả mạo trên TripAdvisor. Làm thế nào các bạn sẽ xử lý các đánh giá trên nền tảng của bạn? Bạn có thể nói rõ hơn về chủ đề này không, vì đây là vấn đề rất quan trọng trong ngành Du lịch. Đáp: Chúng tôi sẽ sử dụng hợp đồng thông minh trong việc đặt chỗ của chúng tôi để xác minh rằng người dùng đã thực sự ở lại khách sạn trước khi họ có thể viết đánh giá hay không. Hỏi: Tôi nhớ rằng các tài khoản doanh nghiệp đã hoạt động trong lần cập nhật gần đây, nhưng đây không phải là điều dễ thấy được ở bất cứ đâu trên trang web, đây có phải là thứ bạn đang xử lý bí mật lúc này không? Đáp: Đúng, chúng rồi đang xử lý bí mật. Hỏi: Có nhiều mối quan hệ đối tác được lên kế hoạch cho quý 3 mà bạn chưa thể nói với chúng tôi chưa? Đáp: Có, chúng tôi có một số quan hệ đối tác được xác nhận sẽ được ra mắt. Như bạn có thể kể ra các mối quan hệ đối tác trước đây của chúng tôi với Dash, litecoin & bitcoin.com, họ sẽ luôn là những bên hợp tác cấp cao nhất. Hỏi: Phí hoa hồng được cho là dao động trong khoảng 5–10% tùy thuộc vào sự trưởng thành của nền tảng. Bạn có thể xác nhận% phí hiện tại là bao nhiêu không? Đáp: Hiện tại chúng tôi hoạt động với mức phí 10%. Mặc dù chúng tôi vẫn duy trì mức chiết khấu trung bình 15% cho nguồn cung có sẵn của chúng tôi cho người dùng. Hỏi: Hiện tại Travala có bao nhiêu nhân viên? Đáp: Chúng tôi hiện có 26 nhân viên. Hỏi: Bạn có thông tin chi tiết nào về CTO mới không? Đáp: Chắc chắn rồi, bạn có thể tìm hiểu về anh ấy ở đây — https://www.linkedin.com/in/tứ-quý-phạm-54317815a/ Hỏi: Có phải những người đóng góp Crowdcube đủ điều kiện vẫn nhận được áo phông và túi goody v.v.. tại một số điểm? Đáp: Chỉ khi họ đầu tư đúng số tiền để nhận được chúng. Hỏi: Khi nào đặt vé máy bay sẽ có trên Travala? Đáp: Các chuyến bay sẽ được thêm vào khi chúng tôi hài lòng với sự tăng trưởng của việc đặt phòng khách sạn. Điều quan trọng là không nên trải mình quá mỏng, đi xuống quá nhiều theo chiều dọc quá sớm có nghĩa là các sản phẩm khác không có đủ sự chú ý mà chúng cần. Chúng tôi liên tục đánh giá cách chúng tôi đang thực hiện trước khi đẩy mạnh các sản phẩm mới và ngành theo chiều dọc. Hỏi: Bạn thích gì khi làm việc tại Travala? Đáp: Tôi không làm việc tại Travala, đây không phải công việc đối với tôi. Đây là lối sống. Tôi tận hưởng tất cả. Hỏi: Việc mua lại Travala sẽ ảnh hưởng đến các token như thế nào? Đáp: Do AVA là một phần quan trọng trong hoạt động của travala.com, sẽ là một điều rất tốt nếu việc mua lại diễn ra. Ngoài ra khi việc mua lại xảy ra thường là công ty được mua cho nhóm. Hỏi: Bạn có bất kỳ kế hoạch để có một chương trình tiền thưởng lỗi như nhiều dự án tiền điện tử đã có? Đáp: Cùng với đội ngũ kiểm toán và an ninh của chúng tôi. Chúng tôi dựa vào cộng đồng tuyệt vời của chúng tôi, chủ sở hữu token và cổ đông để giúp chúng tôi khi họ thấy điều gì đó bất thường. Hỏi: Bạn đã được một trong những OTA lớn tiếp cận hợp tác hoặc có thể cho một tài khoản cấp doanh nghiệp chưa? Đáp: Bộ phận phát triển kinh doanh của chúng tôi không ngừng thúc đẩy các tài khoản cấp doanh nghiệp của chúng tôi. Hỏi: Điều gì sẽ là đồng lực chính để bên bạn giảm số lượng là 5.000 token cần thiết để trở thành mức 5 SMART? Đáp: Nó cũng tùy, chúng tôi không có kế hoạch thay đổi chương trình ở giai đoạn này. Hỏi: Các chi phí để duy trì hệ thống Travala là gì và các chi phí đó được chi trả như thế nào? Chi phí lớn nhất là gì? Đáp: Tiền lương của nhân viên, máy chủ, tiền thuê, chi phí đặt phòng, thu thập người dùng. Chúng tôi tạo ra doanh thu và tỷ lệ đốt của chúng tôi tương đối thấp ngay bây giờ. Chúng tôi vừa hoàn thành một đợt gây quỹ cộng đồng và sẽ tiếp tục thực hiện các vòng đầu tư khi chúng tôi cần đẩy thêm vốn vào sự tăng trưởng của nền tảng. Hỏi: Có cách nào để có một sneak peak của trang web mới không? Đáp: Không. Hỏi: Bạn dự kiến ​​sẽ có bao nhiêu nhân viên vào cuối quý 3? Đáp: Không quá 30. Hỏi: Bạn có hài lòng với sự phát triển của Travala cho đến nay? Đáp: Có, đội ngũ của chúng tôi đã làm tốt hơn mong đợi trên tất cả các lĩnh vực. Đội ngũ của chúng tôi là đẳng cấp thế giới, tôi mong muốn tiếp tục đạt được những thành tích ngoài mong đợi. Hỏi: Nếu ngày đặt phòng đã chọn không có phòng, kết quả tìm kiếm có thể cung cấp ngày có phòng tiếp theo không? Hay chức năng này đã có? Đáp: Ngay bây giờ, nền tảng này không hoạt động như thế nhưng chúng tôi có thể thêm vào. Tuy nhiên, điều quan trọng là với tư cách là người dùng, bạn đã được thông báo rõ ràng rằng những ngày đó không có phòng trước khi chúng tôi chuyển một ngày khác cho bạn. Bạn có thể không nhận thấy và nghĩ rằng bạn đang đặt phòng cho ngày bạn đã chọn. Hỏi: Với khoản đầu tư EcoFund của NEO, mục tiêu tăng trưởng chiến lược mới của Travala.com là gì? Đáp: Tại Travala.com, chúng tôi tiếp tục thúc đẩy chiến lược của mình theo hướng sử dụng tiền điện tử trên toàn cầu để đặt phòng khách sạn và nhà ở. Khoản đầu tư đến cùng với khoản gây quỹ cộng đồng đã hoàn thành gần đây, và khi bắt đầu loạt đầu tư vòng A, chúng tôi sẽ tiếp tục thúc đẩy sự phát triển của nền tảng travala.com. Hỏi: Chúng ta có thể mong đợi chiến dịch marketing lớn hơn về mặt chi tiêu quảng cáo sau khi phiên bản beta xuất hiện vào tháng 8 không, hay chiến dịch marketing sẽ tăng lên sau đó trong quý 3 hoặc quý 4? Đáp: Chi tiêu cho quảng cáo sẽ tăng lên ở giai đoạn sau, chúng tôi hiện đang hợp tác chặt chẽ với một nhóm tại Google để biết cách chúng tôi sẽ đưa ra chiến lược này. Hỏi: Việc thị trường tiền điện tử giảm xuống ảnh hưởng bao nhiêu đến mô hình của bạn? Bạn có chuẩn bị tốt cho một mùa đông tiền điện tử kéo dài hay không? và bạn dựa bao nhiêu vào giá tiền điện tử để lựa chọn ổn định hay lấy thêm thu nhập ở đâu? Đáp: Chúng tôi cung cấp quyền truy cập vào các danh sách của chúng tôi bằng thẻ tín dụng / thẻ ghi nợ, Paypal và các phương thức tiền pháp định khác, cùng với nhiều loại tiền điện tử. Chúng tôi không dựa vào thị trường tiền điện tử hoặc giá tiền điện tử để hoạt động. Hỏi: Cá nhân bạn có tin rằng chúng ta sẽ được liệt kê trên Kayak vào năm 2019 không? Đáp: Nó thực sự phụ thuộc vào việc chúng ta có thể phát triển nhanh như thế nào, nếu chúng ta đạt được mục tiêu của mình, thì tôi tin rằng nó sẽ xảy ra vào cuối năm 2019 / đầu năm 2020. Hỏi: Bạn nghĩ gì về blockchain NEO? Đáp: Nó đang cải thiện và tôi mong muốn được thấy 3.0 được tung ra thì sẽ như thế nào.

Scroll down to see the best-dressed at this year’s Oscars. Lady Gaga just broke her dress formula which changed things up from red carpet past. Gaga first attended the Academy Awards in 2014 in an ultra pale pink strapless Versace column gown with metallic embellishments and a floor sweeping scarf slung backwards around her neck. Crazy Rich Asians was the first major Hollywood studio film with an all-Asian cast since 1993’s The Joy Luck Club. To date, the film has earned more than $170 million at the US box office, quelling the notion that films with predominantly Asian casts aren’t marketable or relatable. The film also drew nominations at this year’s Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture — Comedy or Musical and Best Actress in a Motion Picture — Comedy or Musical for Constance Wu. Clarke has been nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards and six Screen Actor Guild Awards. As of 2018, she has won ten awards from 29 nominations. Since her rise to prominence, Clarke has contributed time and effort to a variety of charitable organisations. In 2019, following the announcement of the brain aneurysms she suffered in 2011 and 2013, Clarke launched SameYou. The charity aims to increase the access neurorehabilitation in young people after brain injury or stroke. One of the first arrivals on the red carpet, Porter stole social media’s gaze with a gender-defying velvet tuxedo gown. Billy porter, one of the first to arrive, became one of the night’s most talked-about stars when he arrived ina black velvet tux dress by Christian Siriano. The designer tweeted a gif of the actor spinning in his creation, saying it was an “honor to create this moment”. His supersized bow tie was an additional dose of flair. The dress x tuxedo hybrid was also totally “fierce,” which was the buzz word that Siriano often uttered during his winning season on Project Runway. Crazy rich asians’s star Gemma Chan heats up hollywood. Up till mid-August 2018, Chan was an oft-working British actress, not yet an A-list celeb or boldface name. Crazy beautiful, she’d done a modeling stint; crazy brainy, she graduated from Oxford with a law degree in 2004. What a difference four months makes. Chan stunned as wealthy-but-heartbroken cousin Astrid in the groundbreaking “Crazy Rich Asians” — Hollywood’s first film in 25 years to feature an all-Asian cast — which has racked up more than $238 million worldwide and countless great reviews.

https://medium.com/@mayaberlerner/parallel-application-delivery-1c8c16f1494c?source=tag_archive---------93-----------------------,Parallel application delivery,part 3,Maya Ber Lerner,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Maya Ber Lerner Follow -- Listen Share Part 3 of 3| go to Part 1|go to Part 2 If the application delivery is modeled as a series circuit, loading more tasks and tools to the DevOps toolchain is like adding light bulbs to a series circuit: the more you add, the current goes down and the bulbs become dimmer Improving application delivery speed when you model it as a series circuit becomes a challenge when your application delivery is not very simple (if you missed it, read part 2). How about going parallel? When a few bulbs are connected in series, the voltage is divided between them. This makes the current slower than if the same bulbs are connected in parallel. In a parallel circuit, the voltage on each bulb is the same. This means that with the same bulbs you get higher current — and brighter bulbs. So instead of looking at application delivery as a series circuit: You may want to try looking at it as a parallel circuit: Taking this approach, the term “DevOps Toolchain” doesn’t describe the system well. Perhaps “parallel application delivery” or “continuous application delivery” describes it better. The output of your application delivery is value to your customers. But what does the current represent in this model? What is the thing that flows in the application delivery circuit, the thing that you work on and hand-off between the stages? In the series model, you build the application, and then you test the application, and then you deploy the application. Each stage hands-off the application to the next stage. In a parallel model, you do all these things at the same time. You continuously plan, develop, test and offer you application in production. How can this be possible? In order to achieve that, these different activities need to happen on your application at the same time. But how can your application be in six different places at the same time? Well, why not? Why wouldn’t your application be in a hundred different places at the same time? You can install it as many times as you like. The only reason it is difficult to imagine is that your application is not just code packaged as artifacts. A running application is artifacts on infrastructure (and often it’s not just your artifacts, and there’s also the data). Or in other words — it’s the entire application environment. If you could have as many instances of your application environment as you like, you would be able to develop, test, secure and operate in parallel. In the series model, you’re trying to pass your code downstream (in the form of artifacts) and each stage puts it on different infrastructure with a different configuration. What if you could get each of these stages to work on the same application environment? The same environment you develop would also be the environment you test and the environment that your customers experience in production. If you manage to do that, you can work in parallel on the different stages. All tasks become continuous. You test at the same time as you develop but also in production. There is no more shifting left, or right. It just all happens at the same time, because everyone has simultaneous access to instances of the application environment. Imagine that consuming production environments would be seamless. Imagine production environments being provided like water or power. Anyone can just plug in and start consuming. Wouldn’t that be an application delivery game changer? Continuous application delivery requires that you create a foundation for portable application environments to power your system 1. You need a good way to define (blueprint) your application environment, as code. Not just applications. Not just infrastructure. The entire environment. 2. You need a good way to serve these application environments to the different tasks that your application delivery requires — development, functional testing, performance testing, security, production Part 3 of 3| go to Part 1|go to Part 2 -- -- Co-founder and CEO @Chiefyteam @MayaBerLerner | chiefyteam.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*0nnL_uZMOGq5lE--oXBQug.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*0nnL_uZMOGq5lE--oXBQug.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*0nnL_uZMOGq5lE--oXBQug.jpeg"

Here’s some key learnings and insights on how it’s been going… The collectable content or “My Collection” was deployed within our newest permanent gallery called ‘Pou Kanohi, New Zealand at War’. Which is part of the Museum’s WW1 centenary commemorations and also our first war gallery dedicated to formal learners — specifically school years 5–13. That meant that in development we worked closely with teachers to understand the needs of their students; and it is also the reason that we aspired to create a highly interactive gallery, with a suite of digital experiences to suit different learning styles. The overall objective of the collectable content or “My Collection:” was to Provide ways for formal learners to gather content quickly throughout the gallery, meaning students had more time to look at objects rather than lots and lots of text. This was a pilot for us that is still running. And in a nut-shell it gave the ability for students (or the general public) to ‘save’ content that interested them via a ‘My Collection’ Card Just to talk through this process in a bit more detail… There is this red kiosk (See below) located within the gallery that would dispense the ‘My Collection’ cards. The visitor gets this card, which has a unique identifier and QR code on the back. Visitors could then go and go save content from any of the Chronology and Letters interactives, 11 interactives in Total. When the visitor is using the interactive and they find a piece for content that they would like to capture and read more about later. For example this piece if content here, a letter that lieutenant Harry Dansey often wrote to his sweetheart Pat.. There is this symbol with a Infrared Scanner next to the interactive. They place their card under the scanner, the interactive then prompts the visitor to place in their email address. In case you missed the card kiosk you can also save content from the interactive without it. There is a ‘Save Content’ call to action on pieces of content, where you can place in your email address to collect the content directly. Finally, that piece of content gets sent to the visitors unique web landing page identified with their card. We also emailed them so they have the unique link of their account for the future. Here is the generic top level Analytics for this experience. This data was collected from 8th March to 8th October 2018 as analytics for the interactives were not set up after the gallery opened, which is another lesson in itself. Over a 7 month period There have been a total over 16, 000 ‘saves’ by visitors across 292 pieces of content . The most frequently saved letter across all the letter saves was ‘A call to all single men’ (470 Saves). Having 1,713 page views. Despite large amount of interaction with this letter, it may not be actually representative of its popularity as this letter is more readily accessible than other letters. It is one of the first letters seen in the user journey.. Overall though this letter comprised of only 3% of all visitors ‘saves’. This demonstrates that visitors are selecting a wide range of content to save. On average, visitors collected 4 pieces of content. The number of content pieces collected ranged of 0 to 172 pieces. The following learnings are a mix of visitor marketing research and Google Analytics Clear Instructions With Support Minimise the steps involved Test, Optimise, Repeat Enable what visitors are already doing So given we didn’t actually launch with analytics and that was a a big learning in itself. But just to recap.. Analytics are important, it’s another way to gather insights and it’s pretty low cost to implement. Even if you don’t know what to measure just yet, just place a tag in and keep working on the why. But It’s also hard. Session views in Google Analytics for on floor experiences just don’t work. People walk away from screens mid session, you have multiple people using a screen at once. There’s just some things that Google Analytics can’t see, which leads me to my next point. That Google Analytics alone, just isn’t enough. A hybrid approach of gathering Visitor Marketing Research and Google Analytics is key, so the data you’re gathering is both quantitative and qualitative. If you don’t have a research team just observe on the floor, even ask your visitors directly what they think. It’s easy to get disconnected from what people are actually doing.  And once you’ve got the analytics, define which insights truly matter. We had the average time spent on screen being 1min 20 seconds ..but is this reflective of ‘engaged’ users? What if we filtered out users that drop off under 5 seconds.

https://medium.com/@carleckert353/working-for-yourself-ada4fb649915?source=tag_archive---------39-----------------------,Working For Yourself,Written by Carl Eckert,Carl Eckert,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Carl Eckert Follow -- Listen Share We spend 70% of our time at work. Mine was probably closer to 90%. Make no mistake, this is not a diatribe of self-proclaimed “grit,” a word all too frequent on our Instagram feeds. It’s just a fact. That’s the real point. Everyone’s working hard, everyone’s working late, and everyone loves it. Working passionately, excessively, and often to a point of physical sacrifice, is a defining component of the modern workplace, especially for millennials. We champion hustle culture, a “rise and grind” mentality and re-tweet billion-dollar entrepreneurs who glorify 80-hour work weeks, Ambien dependency and performance-enhancing psychedelics. I happened to be in an understaffed office, the only one under 25, and with something to prove. Corporate America calls this a “lean” business. The first time I heard this, I imagined a trading floor with overly-fit 50-somethings working hard to close deals and even harder in the gym. I was wrong. If you hear this in your next interview, consider it with a reverse correlation to low body fat, full hairlines, and mental sanity. It’s funny what a lack of sleep will do to your brain! Simple tasks seem nauseatingly complex, loved ones are adversaries and your time, and how you choose to spend it, becomes increasingly self-important. Not sleeping, and all the discomfort, will drive you to question what you’re really doing: your career choices, your essence, and even your spirituality. My lack of sleep led me to Buddhism with a hope I would find the greater meaning beyond my stressed-out self, the professional rat race and a daily 16-hour grind. While I can’t say Buddhism holds all the answers, it introduced me to an ancient practice grounded on fundamentals of introspection, self-awareness, and disconnection. Meditation truly changed my life. By taking a few minutes to sit with my thoughts, watch objectively as they pass and focus on my breathing as a point of detachment from chaotic internal chatter, I was hit with sensations of restoration, clarity, and acceptance. I was also surprised at the growing amount of research linking meditation to improvements in physical health. Reports from the American Psychological Association connected meditation to decreased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. The Mayo Clinic found a correlation to improved cardiovascular function, lower blood pressure and a decreased chance of heart failure. Harvard also concluded that daily practice can reducethe effects of longevity, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Like nearly 26 million other people, I downloaded the meditation app Calm and became enamored with its user experience, soothing sound and impact of its content. It created a convenient venue to develop a regular practice, regardless of work-life balance, and to learn, develop and appreciate a newfound aptitude that was quickly improving my quality of life. The only challenge was finding a place at work. I would try to meditate before but I was already waking up at an ungodly hour and finding time after 11 pm was next to impossible. Meditating in empty conference rooms seemed logical, I was just awkwardly interrupted by colleagues, and doing it out in the open, or at my desk, seemed a bit too outwardly “zen.” I began regularly retreating, usually a few minutes after I arrived, to my car. But mornings quickly became so chaotic that as soon as I showed my face, it was hard to get out of dodge and being gone, even for fifteen minutes, would have raised “questions” in a high-attrition environment. What became more frequent, was meditating alone at night, in my car, in the garage. In order to get Calm through the Bluetooth, I had to keep the car running. I didn’t realize the picture I was painting until 1:47 am on a Wednesday when a 71-year old parking attendant, furiously pounded on my window attempting to pry the door off as if the car was trapped at the bottom of the Hudson in January quickly filling with icy water. After reassuring a new friend, and the epitome of a good Samaritan, I realized the absurdity far-extended the embarrassing situation. How did it make any sense that offices are stocked with amenities like nap rooms, ping-pong tables, and craft beer but there was nothing for the preservation of mental health, balance, or personal sustainability? I was trying to work harder, not escape my job, by taking time for myself to later return with a renewed sense of focus. Why feel ashamed? What began as an inquiry set up the foundation for a deeper vision. I imagined a future workplace to not just pursue careers, but also mental and emotional wellbeing. All of this stemming from a unique product that answered my demand, and what turned out to be the needs of many others, for a dedicated physical space powered by all the benefits of health-tech, artificial intelligence, and app-based meditation. Taking this one step further, what if that space and that technology got to know you personally? It knew everything important to you from a deeply intimate standpoint. Things like getting better sleep, being more creative or having better relationships. And imagine if it acted as a friend for your brain, right at work, and helped you achieve those goals and become the person you’ve always wanted to be? Think what that would do for yourself, your friends and your business? That’s why we founded Pause. We’re working on a smart space that’s your sanctuary at work, not to escape, but to improve. If you’re working hard, you deserve it. Why put your health on hold for the sake of your career? Doesn’t that seem like an utterly illogical paradox? Isn’t health at the end of the day, next to family and friends, all we really have? Another question I ask hard-working people is: What if you actually felt better after your workday? Sounds crazy, right? It’s definitely unusual but in a few months, we think it’s possible. With content from award-winning providers and smart programming, we’ll let you identify what is important and empower you with the tools to get there. We’ll even show you the biofeedback that it’s working. And, the best part is that all of this is available in one convenient location that you can return to as it suits your busy schedule. Our hope is that by building these spaces geared to your wellbeing, we’ll change your life just like meditation changed mine, with greater outcomes for you, your colleagues and the world around us. We spend 70% of our life at work. Let’s make it worth it. -- -- Amelia, CEO & Co-founder Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*4nK9ZhHSebdMoGv5.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*4nK9ZhHSebdMoGv5.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*4nK9ZhHSebdMoGv5.jpg"

For example, you have two different environments (Production & Test) in two different regions. You want to restrict your dev team to only access the services in your test environment and not the ones in your production environment. In this case, region-based access is a handy thing. You can create an IAM user with a custom policy attached to it that lets the user access only the services in a specified region. In this article, we will have a step by step walkthrough on creating IAM policies with region-based access. We will be creating a policy for EC2 & S3 services and the region will be Mumbai (ap-south-1). If you don’t have an AWS account yet, you can signup for a free account here. If you already have an AWS account just log in to your account & go to the IAM service. Follow the steps below to create a region-based access policy : 3. Now, Choose the “JSON” policy editor and click on the “Import Managed Policy” option. 4. Choose the service policies you want to add. I have chosen full access for EC2 & S3. 5. Once you import the policies you will see some JSON in the editor like the below. 7. To add region-based access to the above policy we need to add a condition to each resource that will allow access only to the specified region which is ap-south-1 (Mumbai) in our example. Below is the condition we need to add to each of our resources. The condition above states that access only to the given region (ap-south-1) is allowed and all other region access is denied. 8. After, adding the condition to each resource the JSON would look like this. 9. Once your region-based policy is ready to use, click on “Review Policy”. 10. Add a “Name” and “Description” to the policy and then click on “Create Policy”. Your policy has been created and now you can attach the policy to a user or group. These types of policies can be beneficial while providing different levels of access to users for various services in multiple regions. You can also add multiple regions to the condition if you want to provide access to multiple regions in the same policy. To provide access to multiple regions in the same policy just update the condition to the following - Thanks for reading the article, hope it helps. -- -- DevOps Engineer with 6+ years of experience designing scalable and secure solutions in the cloud.

Internet users know their data is saved by almost every website they visit, whether in the form of cookies, collection of personal information or using phone settings. The debate today is no longer on if it is acceptable for websites to collect our information but rather on how in-depth this information can be, how long it is kept and what are the website security settings.

Each of us falls somewhere on the spectrum between keeping our privacy and experiencing all of the conveniences data sharing can provide, from people who avoid smartphones altogether to some who share their location with every shady app and give their friend list to every popular Facebook test. For those that fall somewhere in the middle, here is a list of suggestions what you can do to avoid a total breach of privacy without returning to the Middle Ages.

Basically, this assumption emphasizes the knowledge problem faced by many enterprises today: in any given sphere of activity most of the pertinent knowledge will reside outside the company’s boundaries such as start-ups, inventors or academia, and the central challenge for those charged with the innovation mission is to find ways to access that knowledge. Joy’s law perfectly embodies the essence of Open Innovation as raising Innovation Management model for large corporate. The purpose of Open Innovation strategy is essentially to open up the innovation process. The beauty is in the execution of the two-way engine: the outside-in mechanism allows to assimilate in a controlled and standardized way external inputs such as products, ideas, technology, knowledge or patents in order to enables companies to enhance radically the new product development process or enrich their product portfolio. On other hand, inside-out allows exploiting ideas sat on a shelf, selling or commercializing them through co-development, spin off or partnerships. Using these two mechanisms, ideas can flow-in and flow-out from the innovation funnel creating an inflows and outflows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation and to expand the market for external use of innovation, respectively (Chesbrough et al. 2006). The former is called inbound OI, which is synthetically defined as ‘the practice of leveraging the discoveries of others’; the latter is called outbound OI, which is ‘the practice of establishing external relationships with the aim to exploit business opportunities’. In the last twenty years, many factors have contributed on the escalation of Open Innovation model among companies. For instance, the raise of software development costs, the need for rapid new product generation and the shortening product life-cycle have highlighted the need to rethink the way to manage innovation and more specifically, the whole innovation process designing an entire new ecosystem of innovators. Consequently, alliances, partnership and collaborations are progressively becoming essential for companies who are striving to strengthen their innovation leadership. The creation of a balanced and trusted network around the boundaries allow them to quickly respond to opportunities which could occur in the market and to have access to unique and prestigious knowledge . Notwithstanding the great relevance, that open innovation has received in the literature, scant attention has been devoted to the analysis of implementation and execution of the OI strategy. Increasingly, organisations are considering using an open-innovation process, but many are finding that making open innovation work can be more complicated than it looks. This calls for a better understanding of actions implemented by companies willing to pursue open innovation strategies, with relation to both to the idea generation process and to the idea selection. Companies that embrace the OI model, work as innovation seekers withdrawing ideas from external environment as well as innovation providers pushing out unused knowledge to commercialize it. Doubtless, there are challenges that companies have to face if they embrace the OI model as well as threats to evaluate carefully before the adoption. In order to understand the gold rush in the adoption of the OI model, we need to analyse briefly its pros and cons. The most mentioned benefits coming from an open model are the possibilities to reduce time to market through collaboration, on the one hand, and the chance to find new technologies, (highly preferable breakthrough technologies) through the systemically external scouting activities, on the other hand . Furthermore, OI can be implemented to explore new markets and to have access to new knowledge through licensing, joint venture, and strategic alliances, which consequently allow to share R&D costs, time and risks among partners. Additionally, the OI model has attracted some companies because of the possibility to include consumers in early stage of the innovation process to anticipate their needs and thus finding new market trends beforehand. Unfortunately, Open Innovation is not a panacea and Companies should carefully evaluate costs and risks that may appear, as well as benefits coming from openness. Transactional costs (Williamson, 1985) can quickly rise due to scouting activities for identifying the best ideas or the most appropriate innovators. Nevertheless, the evaluation of external sources of knowledge could generate interesting outcomes, but their quality and usability cannot be known beforehand. Additionally, commercializing R&D may generate new revenues coming from licensing out patents, but there are not any empirical evidences on the dimension of this reduction. Furthermore, Companies engaged in partnership are used to share information revealing intellectual properties which were not intent to share. Under this light, OI could backfire Companies’ competitiveness. Consequently, to mitigate the above-mentioned risks and to exploit benefits, companies can take different routes to OI, mainly according to their industry or according to what is driving the impetus to become more open as well. In line with these thoughts, below we provide some evidence of how the OI model has been implemented within Electrolux. Axel Weener-Gren is the founding father of Electrolux, in 1908 he passed by a vacuum cleaner in a store shop window in Vienna and thought to himself that ‘there should be one of these in every home’ despite the fact that this vacuum cleaner had a very high price and its weight was about 20 kilos (Hoffman, 2010). Electrolux is now a global leader in home appliances and appliances for professional use, selling more than 40 million products in 150 markets every year mainly in two product categories: consumer durable (residential kitchen, fabric care and cleaning) and professional product (industrial kitchen, restaurant and laundries). At the end of 2012 the Company had about 61.000 employers in more than 60 countries all over the world. Products include world-leading brand such as AEG, Frigidaire and Rex. Home appliances are often divided into white and brown goods. The term ‘white goods’ refers to major household appliances in the kitchen such as washing machines, refrigerators, dishwashers, ovens and cookers. By contrast, the term ‘brown goods’ addresses appliances used outside the kitchen such as video and audio systems. The white goods industry is a medium-low technological rate which during the last decades, has been characterized by a stagnating demand and decreasing unit values, where products are relatively similar and simple to produce, although assembling different parts and subsystems requires the combination of knowledge domains ranging from mechanics to electronics and plastic modeling (Sobrero and Roberts, 2002). Competitiveness mainly depends from companies’ ability to reach scale economies and to satisfy consumers’ needs. Furthermore, in this context technology changes can make a stable environment became unstable overnight (Pavitt, 1984). Electrolux has shaped its Open Innovation strategy on three pillars: Challenges, Network and Mindset. All of these exactly respond to a specific need that Electrolux is facing to exploit new business opportunities. ● Idea and Technology Challenges — They represent the tool used by Electrolux (but also by many others firms) to interact with the external network, capturing knowledge from the state of idea to ready-product. Electrolux identifies new business opportunities following two different paths: targeted and inspired challenges. Targeted challenges are solicited calls for ideas. More specifically, these are requests for solutions to a specific corporate need, as technical as well as market need identified by the Electrolux corporate strategy. For instance, these challenges might ask for additional functionalities, better components or specific product concept. Certainly, a challenge is launch after internal verification of existing solutions. On the contrary, inspired challenges are unsolicited called for ideas. In other words, these are messages of openness to listen to all innovative proposals aligned to Electrolux business. These allow to capture available solutions, at different levels of readiness, from ideas concept to prototypes, without restrictions. Electrolux does not specify needs, thus innovators are completely free to offer proposals. In the Electrolux OI strategy, the pillar ‘challenges’ includes an important novelty element, represented by the inspired challenges, which allow to stimulate and inspire the ideas generation onto external networks following an approach that overcomes the traditional scouting methodologies. The launch of this type of challenges requires a complex management of IP and the ability to build non-traditional agreements with external partners. ● Network — It answers to the need of creating the ecosystem of innovators around the company’s boundaries. Considering the OI approach, value creation is not just the result of an internal transformation of input into output, but the smart and effective combination of internal and external resources. Before the adoption of the OI model Electrolux had already built a trusted network which include many stakeholders engaged in the innovation process such as suppliers, consumers, University department and research centers. Nevertheless, the OI strategy aims to dramatically expand the number of external partners and move beyond the trusted network, including different players belonging to unknown business sectors. Firms in the external network could be extremely different for dimensions, business sectors, assets and many other features. Electrolux to better manage their business partners has identified 4 macro categories of innovators: (I) Solvers, (II) Brokers, (III) Entrepreneurs, (IV) Inventors, arranging them by their behavior and mindset. These two aspects are essential to reach Electrolux’s goal: exploit business new opportunities. In fact they could have a business mindset, if they strive to gain earnings, if they are able to think strategically about their ideas and if they want to make ideas happen. By contrast, they could have a technical mindset if they are focused on technical improvements or they are able to deliver emerging technologies. Additionally, they could have a proactive behavior that is characterized by a quickly and independent reaction to challenges, or a reactive behavior that is characterized by an anticipatory, change-oriented and self-initiative behaviour. According to these prospective, Electrolux OI team has identified 4 macro categories of innovators into networks: Solvers — Mainly, they are centers of knowledge able to solve hard technical challenges. They have a strong technical background and a reactive behavior. It is clear that, targeted challenges perform better than inspired challenge. They could be firms, research centers and university departments or scientists. Brokers — They are middle way players that play as link among innovators, they work as business partners in creating the word of mouth, which allows to increase and to expand autonomously the network. They have proactive behaviour and technical mindset. Both type of challenges work without differences in term of efficiency. They could be financial groups, industrial associations, business incubators, media players or companies offering specific OI scouting services. Entrepreneurs — They are people who exercises initiative to take benefit of an opportunity, they usually accept the OI challenges to look for business partners to make their ideas happen or to expand their existing business. They usually have a business mindset and a reactive behavior. Inspired challenges perform better than targeted challenges with them. Inventors — Mainly, they are brilliant people with creative personality and technical background able to produce or contrive something previously unknown. They actively contribute in new product development process. They have business mindset and a reactive behavior. Inspired challenges work better with them than target challenges. Given the above, it is clear that all these players play a crucial role in OI model because they allow Electrolux to strongly contribute in the new product development process directly and indirectly. In detail, brokers allow to decrease the effort spent by Electrolux for scouting activities. Presently, Electrolux OI team has mapped more than 700 potential brokers and they have activated more than 200 alliances. Their systematic scouting action allow to Electrolux to have the most attractive firms in its network, without increase transactional costs. In the Electrolux OI strategy, the pillar ‘network’ includes an important novelty element, represented by the creation of brokerage alliances with non-traditional stakeholders: for instance small start-ups can play as brokers in specific geographical areas, forwarding new opportunities through new business models as a well as innovation provider. ● Mindset — It is a set of behaviours, assumptions, methods and mental attitude held by one, more people that creates a powerful incentives to within these people to continue to adopt or accept prior behaviour, choices or tools (Hutchins, 1995). It responds to the need to facilitate and to encourage the exploiting of external resources of innovations, not just using internal centres of knowledge and further to avoid the not-invented here syndrome (Katz, Ralph, and Thomas J. Allen,1982). The distinctive element of Electrolux OI strategy is concerned the 360° experimentation approach, which allows to use and test several methodologies and tools to interact with the network. Electrolux has developed new ways to stimulate external network, pushing OI approach out of the comfort zone, in areas not completely known and where IP management becomes an extremely critical activity. In the light of increasing competitiveness and the squeezing demand in developed market, the implementation of OI seems to be the only way to guarantee a sustainable growth, because of the unfeasibility to increase the rate of innovative products by doubling the investments in R&D, which actually represent the 3% of revenues in household appliances industry. Consequently, the need for dramatic increase in innovation rate cannot be pursued only through the efficiency of the internal R&D. Electrolux cannot be innovative on its own anymore. Under this light, OI aims to disrupt the status quo in the appliances industry feds the corporate business by new flows of ideas. To reach that goal, Electrolux started the implementation of the OI model in May 2011, creating a new specific role, the OI Manager, with the responsibility to design the whole model in order to identify new business opportunities for the Group. Since the beginning, the shift from a closed to an open system has been challenging because of Company’s dimension, the leadership position that strengthens the non-invented here syndrome and the increasing complexity of the internal innovation model. Even if many business units were intrinsically open, implementing the OI strategy mean create a systematic process to exploit new business opportunities that works coupling with the existing innovation management model. This in not means that OI is an additional engine, but it is a sort of turbo system that accelerates the existing engines represented by different company’s functions. The heart of OI implementation has to do with the ways ideas are managed. Before getting into that, it is important to highlight some aspects underlining the OI implementation process. Electrolux has noticed that an effective implementation of the OI model requires the adoption of three main building blocks to exactly translate the OI strategy into practice: Global Engagement — From the beginning of the OI establishment, Electrolux has decided to implement a global OI strategy to exploit new business opportunities spread up in the entire world. The term Global Engagement stresses the will to look for innovations (or ideas, depend from its state-of-art) for all business sectors such as fabric care, laundry, small appliances, accessories and refrigerators engaging in the same time all company’s departments such as Marketing, R&D, Finance, Operations and Production. In this way, Electrolux can systematically look for innovations on global scale through a cross-functional team that withdraws innovations such as additional functionalities for oven, better components for refrigerators, new materials for hood filter, better inbound logistic solutions or new manufacturing processes and then expose them to internal evaluation done by business functions. For instance, a new technology process for ovens chassis developed by a research center in Asia, if caught by the OI team will be evaluated to Electrolux Manufacturing department in Europe. This instance exactly represents the meaning of connection smart people inside and outside the company. Learn by doing approach — Electrolux has been creating a trial and error approach to implement the OI model, showing a real entrepreneurial behaviour going out from the comfort zone and exploring new way of doing business. Starting from every-day practice and using just available resources that are people and knowledge within the Company, Electrolux has been tailoring its own OI model. Implementation was done without the direct involvement of external consultancy firms, but with a strong reference to the past experience in managing external partners that Electrolux had and engaging people who already work in the Company. Basically, Electrolux builds the model learnt to ‘build the car while it is driving it’, since the starting practices which have been adjusted as according to the success of the OI team over time as well as the effectiveness of the innovations developed. Moreover, this method has allowed delivering results rapidly, making innovation acceleration effective in a short time perspective and also contribute to create knowledge, in fact failures, issues and wrong decisions during the development process allow to learn from past experiences and consequently increase performance in the short term. Last but least, Electrolux following this approach has been building a dynamic OI model able to redesign its shape according to internal and external changes. Top-Down and centralized approach — Implementing OI model means also answering questions about organizational control and localization. Basically, this means decide how much freedom in term of budgeting and decision-making should be done at the OI team. Electrolux OI has preferred a centralized approach using a unique cross-functional team with the responsibility to develop the OI model, rather than a distributed approach with responsibilities spread up in several parts of the Company. In that way, Electrolux easily control the cost and the effectiveness of opening the innovation process directly monitoring the ideas flowed and projects developed (there is great deal of debate about how to measure performance in OI, but it has not a central role in this paper). Furthermore, a short hierarchical structure directly connected with top management (Design, Marketing and Finance also called Innovation Triangle) allows saving time shortening as time for decision-making as well as time for product development. Top-down approach has been preferred to clearly communicate the shift from a closed to an open system. Thus, OI was embraced firstly by top managers who work as innovation champions (Di Minin, 2010), and consequently as enablers for a new behaviour towards company’s boundaries, especially reducing NIH syndrome. Electrolux primarily uses the OI model to exploit new business opportunities through the identification of the best ideas. This practically means creating a wide range of processes which allow external stakeholders to submit their ideas and allow the OI team to filter and select the most prominent ones. Electrolux created several standard processes for ideas management, without radically modifying the corporate structure. The main processes are described below. It is a well-known fact that, the ideas generation phase located at the early stage of the innovation process plays a critical role in terms of innovative product rate (Koen et al. 2001; Reid and Brentani, 2004). Even more in open models due to the increased number of stakeholders, which contribute to feed ideas into the innovation funnel from outside the company’s boundaries. Furthermore, Electrolux motivates external innovators using targeted or inspired challenges to receive the highest number and to attract the most prominent ideas. As a consequence, the chances for finding valuable ideas are higher, because the quantity of new ideas is positively correlated with their quality (Dieh and Stroebe, 1987; Simonton, 1999). Certainly, external ideas are in state-of-chaos outside the company’s boundaries and although they are not completely clear and understandable, there is a huge potential in terms of knowledge. This phase, also called scouting phase, is characterized by an extensive information exchange between OI team and innovators in order to clearly clarify the features of each idea. Afterwards, collecting the required information without revealing confidential information, ideas are filtered, using a set of perspectives called ‘Filtering Deliverables’ (discussed in the next paragraph) and the most prominent go forward in the innovation funnel. By contrast, ideas not attractive for Electrolux are rejected, modified or promoted to other stakeholders in the external network. The peculiar element of Electrolux challenges is exactly this specification between inspired and targeted, which allow receiving a higher number on the one hand, and a different type of ideas, on the other hand. More specifically, the inspired challenges show a better performance than the targeted ones, in fact the former has a success rate of 20% while the latter has just 5%. This means that, 1 idea out of 5 coming from inspired challenge is a prominent idea. However, it is important highlighting the motivation effect of both the typologies of challenge, and their complementary nature, that allow to attract as ideas relevant to a specific corporate need as well as ideas to exploit opportunities in the market. Because of the huge amount of ideas, Electrolux OI model is based on a strong filtering system, able to evaluate quickly and accurately the potential of the received ideas. The filtering process is often challenging in open model because number of ideas received is not easy to foreseen and often they are extremely different in term of contents. Sets of perspectives called ‘Filtering Deliverables’ have been created by Electrolux to understand the ideas potential beforehand. These perspectives are called: ‘Consumer Opportunity’, ‘Business Opportunity’ and ‘Alliance Viability’. The perspective Consumer Opportunity analyzes the idea potential through the consumers’ point of view. Firstly, Electrolux have to be sure to might deliver new value to consumers through the idea under evaluation. Thus, a project goal is identify to clearly point out how the idea contribute to create new value to consumers. A new functionality or a new design for small appliances could be good examples of project goals. Secondly, the OI team supposes and foresees benefits for consumers making the idea happen. Lastly, it is evaluated the unique selling proposition (USP) that highlights the distinctiveness and the uniqueness of the idea under evaluation. Using these different points of view, Electrolux strives to understand the opportunity for consumers beforehand. The perspective Business Opportunity analyzes the ideas through the Electrolux’s point of view. Thus, the OI team elaborates a projection of the idea under evaluation in the current economic landscape, in order to understand whether or not it is competitive. For instance, solutions already present in the market might be a good indicator of the idea competitiveness. Furthermore, the OI team checks that the idea is aligned with the corporate strategy. Lastly, it is evaluated the compliance between the corporate business model and the idea business model. The perspective Alliance Viability analyzes idea potential through innovator’s competences and assets point of view. It describes partner capabilities and goals, in order to understand whether capabilities are complementary and goals aligned. Additionally, the OI team analyses available tools used for IP protection and suppose potential alliances models, accordingly. Below is reported the filtering deliverables applied to a generic product idea (fig.2). Figure 3: Filtering Deliverables for product idea Under this light, it is easy to observe that innovation in an open context occurs through the interaction of three pillars: raising consumer’s needs, change in the market and complementary knowledge between parts. Applying these set of perspectives, the Electrolux OI model merges the theoretical insight to filtering activities to the daily trial and error experience in order to correctly create a path to evaluate ideas. In this way, it is likely to solve some relevant issues: evaluate a higher number of ideas coming from stakeholders belonging to different industries and consequently with different backgrounds. In order to achieve the main goal of OI model, identify new business opportunities, the OI team aims not just to recognize business opportunities but further to maximize the ideas’ speed inside the funnel in order to minimize the time from idea generation to the product launch. Specifically, the experience gained from the continuous developing of ideas as successfully as well as fruitless has allowed Electrolux to considerably reduce time to market and further to understand better how to identify a prominent ideas using the above-mentioned set of perspectives. On regularly monthly basis, the most prominent ideas are showed to Electrolux internal stakeholders in charge to decide on a value of an idea in terms of innovative impact on corporate business. For products ideas, stakeholders belong to Marketing, Research and Development and Design global departments composing a cross-functional board called  Innovation Triangle. Each geographic sector such as North and Latin America, Asia Pacific and EMEA has a proper innovation triangle which runs periodically boards with the OI team to decide which ideas develop. Parallel to sectors, global stakeholders are in charge to deliver decisions about innovative ideas representing global business opportunities. For ideas in manufacturing area, stakeholders belong to process engineering departments, Quality and Research and Development. With reference to product ideas, the multidisciplinary dimension of the innovation triangle is the crucial element to deliver committed and successful solutions to the market, while the geographical set up of the innovation triangle is fundamental to evaluate solutions that suite regional consumer’s preferences. When ideas are approved by the Innovation Triangle, they enter in a standard product development process that makes ideas happen. By contrast, ideas rejected will not be developed, but the OI team enables external business partners to connect with other stakeholders that may be interested to develop their idea. Meanwhile, ideas rejected never go completely away from the external network and this peculiar element allows creating the word of mouth among innovators, expanding autonomously the network without effort. Why are some companies winning the game more than others using their open models (Dahlanler and Grann, 2010)? Which are the aspects of the Electrolux model making the company better off than others in exploiting the advantages of an open innovation system? Electrolux OI model has several peculiar aspects, which affected not only the performance in terms of innovative product rate but also in terms of business development. Firstly, the Electrolux OI model clearly demonstrates the advantages to offer an opportunity to the external partners to do business together. This is a great incentive to attract a wider range of participants to come up with their ideas. It is proven through this case study, especially looking at the number of ideas received, that monetary or material benefits are secondary for people’s motivation in creating better ideas or products. By contrast, the opportunity to do business with a successful company is extraordinary appealing. In this way, Electrolux has been able to attract a higher number of participants with wider backgrounds that in turn means more and diversified knowledge and thus higher possibility to find valuable ideas. Secondly, in the Electrolux OI strategy the inspired challenges represent an important novelty element, which allow stimulating and inspiring the ideas generation onto external networks following an approach that overcomes the traditional scouting methodologies. Additionally, the creation of brokerage alliances with non-traditional stakeholders allows to hold scouting costs down. Moreover, the launch of different type of challenges (inspired or targeted) to different type of innovators (entrepreneurs, brokers, inventors and solvers) shows interesting results, that considerably increase the possibility to find prominent ideas. Lastly, Electrolux has built the OI model strongly believing that ideas happen in coffee house and not in a shared platform. A large part of the Electrolux OI model is face-to-face and this aspect contributes to the success of the OI model, which encourages a better dialogue, a fruitful exchange of ideas and the rapid development of trust, that become essential when IP management is critical. As a consequence, Electrolux has been able to create an innovation context, creating a real rush for doing business with a successful firm. Nevertheless, there are some unanswered questions and issues: in fact, IP management could be difficult without legal tools, and some partners are more reluctant to share ideas with big companies in order to avoid the risk to lose the idea ownership. Even through, trust creation is essential to reduce opportunistic behaviour between parts, is not enough to feel comfortable innovators such as SMEs, start-ups and inventors. Often non-disclosure agreement is required to reach a deeper level of accuracy to understand the potential of the idea beforehand. By contrast, managing a huge amount of ideas and partners is challenging because it clearly improves the complexity of the internal innovation management model. In fact, internal costs for ideas evaluation and selection might rise rapidly and in the long term Electrolux might evaluate to push out also this process. But what would occur if Electrolux opened their ideas selection to outsiders, and further what are the best outsiders to involve in the selection process? Several scenarios might occur in the future and but now it is quite hasty for us to make a projection. In view of this, to guarantee the success of such OI model, the implementation phase has been playing a critical role. As matter of fact, adopting a trial-and-error approach based on every day practices has allowed to Electrolux to build a deeper understanding about the management of the OI model. Including in its network unconventional stakeholders, which allow to autonomously improving the quantity and the quality of the innovators in the ecosystem, enable Electrolux to reduce transactional costs for sourcing of external ideas. One last comment has to do with developing the best model for OI and implementing it in the more efficient way. Throughout our experience in Electrolux we had the clear feeling that the model that we described above has emerged from the match between theoretical insights and the daily trial and error experience. The Electrolux team has developed a new model, moving from what theory suggests and adapting it every day on the context of Electrolux worldwide, by building on the field insights through a process, which has eventually turned out the fine grained model that we have described here. -- -- Product Management @Mastercard Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*ZcJfX_w4jkJGUtZN.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*ZcJfX_w4jkJGUtZN.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*ZcJfX_w4jkJGUtZN.jpeg"

The story of Circles.Life began in 2016 when we disrupted the telco industry in Singapore, but our journey doesn’t stop there. Beyond our telco offerings, we have gone on to provide personalized digital services — Discover events and Movies are the first few of many more — and have since embarked on growing our presence internationally. In case you haven’t heard, we’ve expanded outside of Singapore: Circles.Life is now live in Taiwan and Australia! Here is the challenge we face: there is a lot of data to process each month — and this amount is steadily growing. With an increasing customer base and the launch of various ecosystem products that fall outside of our telco realm, our data grows at an alarming rate of 4X every month. At this scale, ordinary data warehouse solutions fail to process data faster, which meant we had to innovate and come up with an alternative viable solution. Now enter Wormhole, an open-source Dockerized solution for deploying Presto and Alluxio clusters for blazing fast analytics on filesystems (in our set-up, we use S3, GCS, OSS). This blog article will go through the process in which we decided on and implemented our solution, Wormhole. We began by exploring multiple OLAP solutions and came across two promising candidates: Presto and Ignite. Upon further exploration and testing, we noticed a few limitations of Ignite: it is difficult to set up, it exists as a monolithic component, and there is no certainty of it being cloud agnostic. As a result, we decided to go with Presto. Before doing so, we had to produce data to back our choice — and thus we compared Presto with common solutions like Hive and Spark, and collected the results as shown below. Perfect! With these results, we could see that Presto was definitely the way forward. As we explored the possibilities of Presto, we also came across Alluxio. Alluxio, a distributed cache on Filesystem, is meant to work in tandem with Presto. What Alluxio does is accelerate the subsequent fetch time for Presto workers to get data from buckets, as it caches data on the first run. We compared the queried results again and we obtained the telling chart below: The proof-of-concept could be considered a success, but we ran into the next problem: deployment of this scattered giant. It was becoming extremely painful to deploy the various masters for High Availability (HA) and horizontally scaling the worker nodes manually. We decided to Dockerize all the components which could later go hand-in-hand with Kubernetes. As we were not deploying the beta setup on Kubernetes, we faced the issue of container discovery in the cluster because IPs get replaced by ContainerIDs. Therefore, we utilized the capability of Docker overlay network and used Consul for dynamic discovery. To help you visualize it better, here is a high-level architecture diagram of our solution: Want to set up your own Wormhole Architecture? We’ll explain each component in the order in which they should be set up. Apart from the components above, a Zookeeper quorum setup is required for making the Alluxio master and Presto coordinator highly available (HA). For the complete documentation of this setup, please visit this link. Now that we have set up Presto on top of Alluxio, how do we make it available for everyone to use? Luckily for us, we use Metabase, which has Presto connectivity out of the box. We only needed to add the appropriate configurations and it began working like a charm for all analyses. Presto and Alluxio also provides a UI to track the real-time status of the implementation, which can be really useful. Let’s take a step back for a moment and consider this: by scaling up our analytical capabilities, we are able to keep up with (perhaps even stay on top of) the massive data produced every minute. As Circles.Life is a growing company, equipping our analysts with timely and relevant analyses allows them to not only be able to continue making iterative improvements to existing products, but also to create and test new ideas and solutions to existing problems. With modern solutions like Presto and Alluxio today, we’re able to harness its power through a customized setup like Wormhole, as demonstrated above. As excited as we are, this solution is still in the process of being adopted across the entire organization. The reduction in latency of already-migrated queries has enabled faster business insights and more of such use cases have surfaced since then. We believe that through continued innovation in optimization techniques, it will greatly help us in our mission to make personalized services across the world a reality! We are on a mission to give power back to customers and deliver great personalized digital services. To succeed in this mission, we are looking for heroes who want to join our journey to solve challenging problems across a complete engineering paradigm.

Technology and economics 101. The human brain, belief systems and metaphysics. And lots of AI. That’s what’s included in Byron Reese’s book The Fourth Age, featured in CES 2019. There is no lack of ambition or ability to negotiate a variety of topics. But while the book succeeds in this, and shows methodical approach and intellectual honesty, its optimistic lens hampers its analysis and borders on solutionism. “In The Fourth Age, Byron Reese offers the reader something much more valuable than what to think about Artificial Intelligence and robotics — he focuses on HOW to think about these technologies, and the ways in which they will change the world forever”. “While we can probably agree that the exact future of AI has a lot of unknowns, and hence potential dangers, it doesn’t change the fact that we can choose to view the possibilities through an optimistic lens, as Reese does here”. These are just some of the reviews people have written about The Fourth Age. The former belongs to John Mackey, co-founder and CEO, Whole Foods Market. The latter to an anonymous reviewer. They are both valid, in their own way. This may seem paradoxical at first, so an explanation is due. Byron Reese is the CEO and publisher of the technology research company Gigaom, and the founder of several high-tech companies. Reese has a keen interest in AI, and hosts the Voices in AI podcast. Reese gets to interact with some of AI’s top minds and entrepreneurs regularly, and is presumably embedded in the tech and entrepreneurship culture. This is the book’s greatest asset and most formidable liability at the same time. Reese does a good job at presenting a brief history of everything: the course of humanity from prehistoric time to today, and how technology has evolved and affected humanity through the ages. This sets the stage well, and Reese also ventures on more ambitious undertakings, negotiating topics such as economics and labor, the human brain, free will and consciousness. It may seem overly ambitious, but the fact is that when dealing with artificial intelligence and the future, adressing human intelligence and history is a necessary foundation. The good thing about how Reese approaches such topics is that he presents concise overviews of alternative theories or beliefs, showing how each assumption may lead to different conclusions. The well-made point is that ultimately, some things are less about technology itself, and more about our fundamental assumptions about the world. If you believe in the divine nature of human soul, for example, it’s hard to see how you can also believe in the possibility of creating AI with consciousness. Reese states that he makes no effort to conceal his own assumptions, and that much is true. Reese does mention ideology as a certain cognitive bias, for example claiming that Marx believed machines were at odds with workers. Marx certainly was no Luddite; his work shows admiration for technological progress, but questions the control of the means of production and the distribution of the fruits of this progress. But misrepresentation is not really the issue here – we could attribute this to what is probably a casual acquaintance with Marx’s work. The issue is that Reese displays this ideological bias himself, albeit from a different standpoint. While he offers a grounded analysis of how capital accumulation interacts with technology to widen income inequality, for example, the conclusions he arrives at based on this analysis can only be justified seen through the lens of ideology and overly optimism. Reese also discusses universal basic income as a means of accounting for technological disruption in labor and income inequality, citing statistics, quoting Warren Buffet, and even referring to the commons to build a case. While this seems like an open-minded approach, when Reese offers his own version of a vision for the future, his view on the topic is astonishing. Reese’s view seems to be that in the long run, income inequality does not matter, because there will be abundance for everyone. This is the well-known “tide that raises all boats” argument, taken to its logical extreme. The issues with this are equally extreme, unfortunately. What this basically says is that there is no limit in natural resources. This implies either infinite growth on a finite planet, or interplanetary travel and technological breakthroughs that offer practically infinite resources. That world may be a very interesting place, as shown in Iain M. Bank’s The Culture series. But it’s far from being our world, and seeing this as the end-all is not only misguided, but ultimately dangerous. Our biggest challenge as a species at this time is not interplanetary travel or conscious AI, it is survival. Our current trajectory is towards irreversible climate change, resource depletion, environmental doom, and everything that goes with this. Reese is on the boat of those who think exponential technological progress can, and will, solve everything. Even if it can, and that’s a very big if and a convenient way to kick down the can, this is a short-sighted view. According to the UN, humanity has 10 years to act before the damage on Earth and its climate is irreversible. One would expect this may be a concern for a book which is about, well, the future. We are not talking about some vague or remote possibility, after all, but about the most crucial challenge humanity needs to deal with to even have a future. Reese mentions climate change in passing 1 time in the entire book, while he devotes chapters to things such as implants. This seems like a glaring omission for a book that is about the future of humanity – maybe that’s not futuristic enough to be popular. Judging on his belief that everything is a technical issue, perhaps Reese also believes that something like Geo-engineering can solve the problem within 10 years. Which brings us to another issue. Dealing with climate change requires decision making, coordination and action on a global scale. Reese believes that the underclass has a say in decision making in Democracies. Another oversight in the ‘inequality does not matter’ argument is that money does not just represent buying power, it also represents decision-making power. What happens when income inequality is left unchecked is that decision-making power follows. Buying a bigger TV is not the same as deciding the world needs more TVs. Reese claims we have collectively opted for a “better standard of living”. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that we have been collectively indoctrinated to consume. Reese does mention that people have the power to step up, when given a chance. So it’s quite interesting that the innovation that is praised when applied to technology is so cautiously, if at all, applied to decision making and education. Democracy, often referred to as the means to counter decision-making inequality, is not that different today from ancient Greece: it warrants equality among a closed group of privileged. Reese’s view is optimistic here, too: the patricians will not risk social upheaval, and will therefore grant something to the plebeians. Maybe so. But if history is anything to go by, the patricians may need a little push. Meanwhile, time is running out. So what may turn out to be the biggest obstacle towards this bright future of automation is the fact that social progress is not keeping up with technological progress. It may well be, in fact, that AI favors tyranny. We are collectively unable to keep up with technology in terms of the evolution of our social structure and cognitive biases. Even if technological progress and the economic system that dictates infinite growth were to simply come to a halt now, we would still need time to level the playing field. Offering more technology as the solution to everything is like giving a mad gunman an infinitely more powerful gun, in the hope he will use it better than the one he now has. Placing our hopes on AI that will sort everything out is like waiting for a Deus ex Machina. Yes, technology offers the potential for a better society. But only if used wisely and fairly, and this is the part we are missing and need to focus on. We need to reform the mad gunman, and no AI is going to do this for us. Disclosure: The Fourth Age was provided to me free of charge for review via Gigaom. I used to have a business relationship with Gigaom before Byron Reese became its CEO. After Gigaom was shut down by its former management, myself as well as a number of people who had outstanding invoices with Gigaom lost their money. To the best of my knowledge, none of this debt has been repaid by Gigaom’s new management.

https://medium.com/@dannyeng/missing-home-96786587127f?source=tag_archive---------157-----------------------,Missing home.,Written by Danny Eng,Danny Eng,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Danny Eng Follow -- Listen Share I try to have daily calls with my mom for the last 6 years I’ve been away from home. I just got off the phone with her and we teared up a bit in the end. I’m in San Francisco and she’s back home in Canada. We often forget that when we choose to migrate to different parts of the world for better opportunities, we also sacrifice the time we get to spend with our loved ones. It seems like that’s just a part of the deal — but it’s a deal that we sign and our loved ones just have to go along with. And I don’t think this situation is just relevant to people in Silicon Valley but it’s something that everyday people like the chef in the back of your local restaurant cooking your food to your Uber driver faces every day. They chose to move away from their family in hopes of a better future…for their family. These past few years, I can count the number of days I’ve been home on one hand [exaggerating]. While it’s an incredibly rewarding working in what many can call the “hub of innovation”, many of us leave behind our families who championed us to get here in the first place — and that sucks. It has always been a dream to work and learn amongst the best and brightest but we often forget about the “cost”. It is the “cost” that both drives me to make the most out of my life and it is also the same thing that causes me to question if this is all worth it. I lost my dad before I turned 18. I reason that that’s the cause of why I am so sensitive to this situation. Maybe if my dad was still alive, I’ll feel less inclined to think about home. Maybe if my dad was still alive, I wouldn’t worry about the “cost” too much. Maybe if my dad was still alive, things would be different. But the reality is that he is gone and home is just my mom, my sister and me. Similar to the Gold Rush in the 1800s, in tech, we tend to justify being away from home by sending money back. We’ll buy our family expensive things to show that we’re well-off and that we care. For me, I decided to buy them a new home in our hometown — not in San Francisco. God knows that I can’t afford one in the Bay Area anytime soon lol. I think we do these gestures not purely out of the goodness of our hearts but as a justification for ourselves that we refer to when our family tells us to move back home. And nothing’s wrong with that. That’s just how it is. I’m not sure what I want you to get out of this — or if there’s even a lesson I’m trying to drive this piece towards but if there is, it’ll be to call home regularly and tell them how much you miss them. This world is a busy place and it is easy to be caught up in chasing down your dreams. It is important to not forget the people who helped us get to where we are today. For me, that is my family. For you, it might be someone else. Keep them close and let them know you’re thinking about them. And finally, it is important to achieve your dreams — but don’t neglect your supporters while you’re at it. A quick call home is insignificant when you think about how much of a nightmare it probably was to raise you. Let that be an actionable item. -- -- Product at Affirm.

The “Dave Hill and the Epistemology of Norwegian Black Metal” episode is deadpan gold. The Portal: A show of big ideas and new ways of perceiving the world. Be sure to listen to the conversations with Peter Thiel and Timur Kuran. The Memory Palace: “Beautifully told short, surprising stories of the past, sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes hysterical, often a little bit of both.” “Episode 94 (Numbers)” is a solid starting point — as a father of 4, it made me cry. The Knowledge Project: A show that takes you inside the heads of remarkable people to “explore the frameworks and mental models that you can use to make life more meaningful and productive.” I really enjoyed the conversation with Naval Ravikant. Slow Burn: Season 2 is an excellent retelling of the saga of Bill Clinton’s impeachment. The Rewatchables: Bill Simmons and the Ringer crew go deep on the movies “they can’t seem to stop watching.” If you liked “Tombstone” or “Fatal Attraction,” start with those episodes. Lost Notes: Some of “the greatest music stories never truly told.” The “Ballad of Glen Sherley” and “Louie Louie” episodes are solid. Welcome to LA: A show about Los Angeles and “the stories of the people who learn what lies beyond the dream.” The episodes entitled, “The Case of the Missing Sprinkles” and “Pan’s Plans” are good jumping off points. Uncivil: A show that “ransacks the official version of the Civil War,” and “ruins the history you grew up with.” Start with the episode entitled, “The Ring.” The Ezra Klein Show: A show of “far-reaching conversations about hard problems, big ideas, illuminating theories, and cutting-edge research.” S-Town: A series about a man who “despises his Alabama town and decides to do something about it.” Conan O’Brien Needs a Friend: Conan attempts to make “real and lasting friendships with his celebrity guests.” I really enjoyed the first episode with Will Farrell. Caliphate: A gripping series that follows a New York Times terrorism correspondent on her quest to understand ISIS. Essential listening.

One major reason is the richness of content from industry experienced authors. Medium is much like AlistApart, and they are my dictionary for what’s happening in the tech industry. So let me just highlight on why Ai: African Intelligence. I am Ghanaian and I have Africa at heart. I am also excited about what this digital age holds for us. Ai simply seeks to explore the disruptive technologies and what is at stake for Africa. I will also share some innovations I am working on as well as my experiences so far and what upcoming African developers or innovators should be focusing on. I hope the various series inspire you. A bit of my background. I am a software Engineer,tech enthusiast and the founder of BPay a Fintech startup. What else? I have a degree and won a few awards. The list goes on and on. Lastly I am a Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Fellow. With over 6 years of experience in the fast growing tech industry, upcoming African developers try extra hard to find their feet. From JS to JQuery to Angular to VueJs to… I hope you can relate. There is always a new framework to learn. From Object Oriented Programming to ML to AI. These learning curves can be daunting. From Statistics to Big Data to Data Science. Oh my! So many opportunities and options. An MIS Degree or Computer Science Degree is just the starting point. The tech industry is huge and navigating it can be demanding. After many years of web programming I want to venture into Data Science and AI. Identifying the starting point is even a chore. Looking at Africa, the Data Science, Big Data, ML and AI sectors are very immature.What makes it worse is the disconnect between academia and industry.So African tech wannabes have to work harder to meet standards like the Silicon Valley startups. I know it is not just about skill sets but economic policies play a part too. My next series will dive more into navigating the tech terrain as an African innovator.

The renewed spike of interest is driven in part by popular characterizations of novel AI techniques as revolutionary, ostensibly on par with the discovery of fire, electricity, or nuclear weapons.1 It is also driven in part by the rapid absorption of nascent AI-based technologies — primarily driven by novel machine learning techniques — into diverse sectors of the global economy, often with transformative effects (as for example in the sciences and in social media). It is also driven, however, in large part by the great power ambitions of America’s competitors and potential adversaries. Echoing the 19th century naval strategist Alfred Mahan (“Whoever rules the waves rules the world”), Russia’s President Putin has stated that the nation that rules in AI “will be the ruler of the world.”2 China’s leader Xi Jinping is perhaps less demonstrative publicly, but has committed to making China the dominant global AI power by 2030, following what was widely heralded as China’s “Sputnik moment” after the loss by Lee Sedol to AlphaGo in 2016.3 There are mounting fears that the United States is woefully under-prepared to manage these new challenges, and that the United States will end up “offset” due to the sheer scale at which the Chinese intend to deploy AI. Could AI disrupt and reshape the strategic international balance, as blue water navies and nuclear weapons did in previous eras? Might it do so in a manner so severe that it leads to war? Is an AI arms race underway?4 Will imbalances and changing perceptions of capabilities undermine the status quo of what is needed to maintain strategic stability between near-peer powers? The purpose of this paper is to begin to answer some of these questions and contribute to the growing body of research and analysis, while calibrating the potential risks and rewards of military applications of AI technologies and determining which issues demand further research — and action. To do so, this paper explores the following questions: ​ This paper frames large questions and provides first-order level arguments about them. It is intended to begin a conversation but not to delve systematically into any one specific aspect. It draws on ideas developed via workshops convened by Technology for Global Security and the Center for Global Security Research (CGSR) in June and September 2018, as well as ongoing engagement with AI researchers based primarily in the California Bay Area.5 These discussions have engaged a diverse mix of public and private sector experts in an exploration of the roles and consequences of AI in the military context. The paper also draws upon prior work at CGSR on disruptive and latent technologies in the 21st century security context.6 This project was a collaboration with the Center for Global Security Research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The views expressed do not necessarily reflect those of LLNL, the Department of Energy, or the U.S. Government. Defining “AI”​Much of the hype surrounding AI in the national security context stems from the fuzziness of our understanding of the technologies that combine to make what is now commonly referred to as “AI”.7 The term “AI” is used to describe a wide range of loosely-related techniques that are generally associated with using machines to glean insight from data in order to satisfy a set of goals. Similar to how the generic term “cyber” is used in reference to everything from networks to hardware, software, automation, industrial controls, hacking, bullying, warfare, and social media, AI is used as a generic term that washes over meaningful distinctions between different manifestations of AI. This breeds confusion, especially regarding claims about its revolutionary effects. So far, the national security community lacks a detailed appreciation of the different technologies and the timelines by which they might mature into militarily-significant capabilities. For the vast majority of currently popular applications, AI consists of algorithms that form the basis of pattern recognition software that is able to interpret, organize, and make predictions. When combined with high performance computing power, data scientists are able to probe and find meaning in massive datasets. Neural networks supercharge the ability of the algorithms to identify and organize patterns in the data by “training” them to associate specific patterns with desired outcomes. Multiple layers of neural networks, known as deep learning neural networks, are what make current approaches to “machine learning,” “supervised learning,” and “reinforcement learning” possible.8 However, the neural network approach represents only a fraction of the advancements in AI methods. For example, AI also includes language processing, knowledge representation, and inferential reasoning, which are all increasingly possible due to advancements in software, hardware, data collection, and data storage. Novel AI provides a leap in the ability to find needles in data haystacks–as long as you know what you are looking for. Despite it being repeated often, it is useful to distinguish between “narrow” and “general” applications of AI. Narrow AI encompasses discrete problem-solving tools designed to perform specific, “narrow” tasks. General AI encompasses technologies designed to mimic and recreate functions of the human brain across domains. The gap between the two is significant. Most experts appear to agree that the accomplishments of narrow AI, though significant, are a long way from the requirements of replicating human-like reasoning. Although Alphabet’s Deep Mind, OpenAI, and others have continued to make impressive breakthroughs in replicating human reasoning, they remain far from matching the performance of the human brain in its multiple contextualized and real-world dimensions. The quest for “superintelligence”9 notwithstanding, recent progress in brain enhancement for now mostly replenishes impaired functions10 and has a long way to go before it is possible to equip citizens, soldiers or robots with super-human powers.11 Although general AI stimulates intriguing science fiction about cyborgs, space wars, and robot armies, narrow AI is already here — and has been for some time. Narrow AI is already in broad use in the private sector. In both business and science, AI has wide applications, primarily in data-rich research fields, including fundamental research (e.g., in physics, chemistry, and biology) and applied sciences (e.g., medicine, aeronautics, and environmental studies). Data science is facilitating rapid advancements in many aspects of scientific discovery, even changing long-held methodological standards and practices.12 Figure 1 demonstrates scientific areas where AI-fueled deep learning is having its greatest effect. The crossover of AI into business applications has super-charged predictive analytics for market research, consumer behavior, logistics, quality control, and many other data-rich areas. The proliferation of cameras and sensors creates even more opportunities for data analysis. When combined with robotics, AI is ushering in a new industrial age with far-reaching societal implications for labor, management, and economic equality.13 For these scientific and business applications, AI is an enabling technology, a cross-cutting force multiplier when coupled with existing data-centric systems, such as the internet, health care, social media, industrial processes, transportation, and just about every aspect of the global economy, where recognizing patterns is the key to insight and profit. Growing interconnectivity, illustrated by the Internet of Things (IOT), is producing more data and providing more opportunity for AI algorithms to reveal hidden insights. For these types of applications, however, AI is increasingly more of a well-established, sustaining and enabling technology than a revolutionary new disruptive technology in its own right. Data analytics is not new, but it is getting better. What Military Applications Are Possible? With this context in mind, the focus of this paper is on AI applications in the military field. Like so many technologies, AI is loaded with latent military potential.14Algorithmic warfare is seen by many as the prime mover of a new revolution in military affairs.15 AI is central to the so- called “third offset” strategy — originally coined by the U.S. Department of Defense in the second term of President Obama16 — and thus has been a principal focus of multiple government initiatives to accelerate the development of advanced technologies. In June 2018, DOD established its Joint Artificial Intelligence Center17 following the White House establishing its Select Committee on AI in May 2018.18 DOD and IC spending on AI has also continued to increase.19 The current U.S. Administration released the beginnings of a national strategy for AI in February, 2019.20 For military applications with direct analogs in the civilian world, like logistics, planning, and transportation, AI-supported data analytics is already in use throughout the defense and intelligence communities.21 These applications are separate and distinct from applications to warfighting. They tend to fall into one of two categories: those that have impact primarily at the operational level of war and those that have impact primarily at the strategic level of war. We define “strategic” as “extraordinarily consequential actions capable of causing a shift in the balance of power.”22 Examples of AI applications with impacts primarily at the operational level of war are: Examples of AI applications with impacts primarily at both the operational and the strategic levels of war are: Omnipresent and Omniscient Autonomous Vehicles: Such vehicles are a high priority for military applications of AI, with much of the focus on navigation for unmanned land, sea and air systems. 23 AI is at the heart of the so-called “drone swarms” that have been the subject of much attention in recent years. 24 AI-informed navigation software supported by ubiquitous sensors not only enables unmanned vehicles to find their way through hostile terrain, but may eventually make it possible for complex formations consisting of various types of unmanned vehicles operating in multiple domains, with complementary armaments to conduct sophisticated battle tactics, instantly adjusting to enemy maneuvers to rapidly exploit battlefield opportunities and report changing conditions. Big Data-Driven Modeling, Simulation, and Wargaming: AI has steadily been increasing the power of simulations and gaming tools used to study nuclear and conventional weapons. From Samuel Glasstone’s early calculations of nuclear effects, to the extensive library of RAND studies on nuclear issues, quantitative methods have been integral to the development of nuclear weapons systems. AI is enabling scientists to model nuclear effects to confirm the reliability of the nuclear stockpile without nuclear testing. Simulation and modeling is already a key part of the design process for nearly all major weapons systems, from jets and ships to spacecraft and precision guided munitions.25 Massive modeling and simulation will be necessary to design the all-encompassing multi-domain system of systems envisioned for battle management and complex missions such as designing, planning and managing systems for space situational awareness. On the production side, AI already informs quality control for novel production methods, such as additive manufacturing.26 ​AI is also enriching battlefield simulations and wargames involving multi-actor interactions. AI enables wargamers to add and modify game variables to explore how dynamic conditions (e.g., weapons, effects, allies, intervention) could affect outcomes and decision-making, and is used to analyze the results of such games. These are examples of evolutionary learning that are unlikely to cause strategic surprise or undermine stability unless the results negatively influence decision-making. Focused Intelligence Collection and Analysis: With so many incoming streams of intelligence being collected from so many sources that all requiring analysis to be useful for policy maker (e.g., HUMINT, SIGINT, GEOINT, MASINT, ELINT, OSINT), the intelligence community faces the challenge of information overload.27 This is a data-centric problem for which AI is well suited.28 For example, a project at Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) uses neural networks to probe multi-modal data sets such as images, text, and video in search of key indicators of proliferation activity. AI also makes it possible to combine open source trade and financial data with multiple forms of intelligence to glean insights about illicit technology transfers, proliferation networks, and the efforts of proliferators to evade detection.29 These insights enable analysts to more rapidly inform policymakers and support counterproliferation policy and actions. ​AI will be an important tool for all-source analysts who are increasingly required to take into account information from many sources, locations, and disciplines to understand today’s global security environment. To the extent that better information leads to informed decisions, applying AI to these collection and analysis problems would likely benefit strategic stability. A System of Systems Enabling Exquisite ISR: For the military, object identification is a natural starting point for AI, as it requires culling images and data collected from satellites and drones to find information of military importance such as the location of missiles, troops, and other intelligence information. Accordingly, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) has led the charge in applying AI to military and intelligence needs.30 But object identification is just the beginning. Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) is the key to multi-domain situational awareness. This awareness is increasingly critical as the battlefield extends to all domains: sea, land, air, space, and cyber on a global scale. Managing and making sense of the staggering amount of ISR data involved in modern warfare is a natural fit for AI, and the objective of DOD’s Project Maven, also known as the Algorithmic Warfare Cross Functional Team, which has received significant increases in recent appropriations bills.31 According to Lieutenant General Jack Shanahan, the Director of Defense Intelligence for Warfighter Support in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (and the incoming chief of the JAIC), Project Maven was conceived as “the spark that kindles the flame front for AI across the rest of the department.”32 While Maven’s initial mission was to help locate ISIS fighters, its implications are vast. Delegation of Decision-Making to Machines and the Acceleration/Improvement of Decision Support Systems: Advances in AI and access to large quantities of data represent a turning point in military decision-making. Multi-domain warfare involves colossal amounts of heterogeneous data streams that can only be exploited with the help of AI. Mirroring the proliferation of sensors in the civilian world, the multi-domain, hybrid warfare battlefield has become a military version of the Internet of Things, teeming with vital information for assessing tactical and strategic threats and opportunities. While the ability to manage this data colossus in real time portends tremendous advantages, failure to draw meaning from that information could spell disaster. Being able to rapidly process the flood of information from varied platforms operating in multiple domains translates into two fundamental military advantages: speed and range. Moving faster than your adversary enhances offensive mobility and makes you harder to hit. Striking from further away similarly benefits the element of surprise and minimizes exposure to enemy fire. These were central tenets of the previous Revolution in Military Affairs that had its debut in the Gulf War. AI makes it possible to analyze dynamic battlefield conditions in real time and strike quickly and optimally while minimizing risks to one’s own forces. As a recent Defense Science Board Study demonstrated, such integrated Battle Management, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (BMC3I) capabilities are well suited to finding and targeting deployed missile batteries, and thus could be the key to countering critical elements of the Anti Access Area Denial (A2AD) strategies of Russia, Iran, and China.33 These systems were designed to exploit vulnerabilities of U.S. land and sea assets in Europe and Asia. In addition to geo-locating targets, AI-enabled BMC3I could help guide and coordinate kinetic effects involving multiple platforms, possibly providing a counter to current A2AD. From this perspective, AI could be a strategic level game changer. Automated Integration of Logistics Systems for Supply and Maintenance: AI technologies allow militaries to automate the coordination of logistical tasks across multiple platforms and locations, making it easier to run large, global operations with less resources and more precision. The ability to analyze massive datasets allows militaries to know when and where supplies are needed, predict when assets require maintenance, foresee supply chain disruptions, and integrate and coordinate several systems and logistical tasks. This in turn drives efficiency and allows for faster, more complex operations — mundane tasks perhaps, but as the adage goes, “Amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals study logistics.” Private industry is already using AI to make faster and better decisions about supply chain and maintenance,34 and the military is catching up with big investments in predictive maintenance.35 These innovations will likely result in increased readiness, more seamless integration of assets across the global, and faster and more effective military strikes. Precision Targeting of Strategic Assets: AI empowered ISR that makes it possible to locate, track and target a variety of enemy weapon systems raises the possibility of striking strategic assets, such as aircraft carriers, mobile missiles, or nuclear weapons. This capability, and perceptions of its existence, could disrupt long-held assumptions about deterrence stability, especially if it appeared possible to conduct a disarming counterforce strike against an adversary’s retaliatory forces.36 The combination of offensive weapons that can “find, fix and finish” a significant portion of an adversary’s strategic assets,37 with defensive systems that can shoot down remaining retaliatory capabilities, would challenge fundamental precepts of deterrence in the nuclear age. Effective Missile Defense: Advancements in AI enhanced targeting and navigation also improve prospects for a wide range of tactical and strategic defense systems, especially ballistic missile defenses, by empowering target acquisition, tracking and discrimination.38 The convergence of powerful new offensive and defensive capabilities has, however, rekindled fears of a surprise attack that could rattle strategic stability. AI Guided Offensive and Defensive Cyber Operations: As an inherently digital domain, the cyber realm naturally lends itself to AI applications, as illustrated by the centrality of AI algorithms for social media companies. The availability of enormous amounts of data in electronic formats is well suited to AI strengths. AI-guided probing, mapping and hacking of computer networks can provide useful data for machine learning, including discovery of network vulnerabilities, identities, profiles, relationships, and other information that could be valuable for offensive and defense purposes.39 On the offensive side, AI could help locate and target particular nodes or individual accounts for collection, disruption or disinformation. Cyber attacks on national command infrastructure and networks, for example, could be catastrophic.40 On the defensive side of the equation, AI can help detect such intrusions and search for debilitating anomalies in civilian and military operating systems.41 AI will equally empower offensive and defensive measures — as has been highlighted in DARPA’s Cyber Grand Challenge.42 AI Threats to Strategic Stability AI has multiple potential applications in the military domain, at both the operational and strategic level of war. But at the strategic level of war, some of the implications may not be altogether positive, as already foreshadowed above. Indeed, the disruptive effects of new technologies cannot be limited to the adversary. Some of those effects are potentially quite significant for the stability of strategic deterrence, by altering the fundamental calculus of deterrence. How might this be so? In the classic Cold War movie WarGames, a young hacker breaks into a DOD supercomputer designed to use AI to plan and execute nuclear war plans. He engages the computer to play Global Thermonuclear War and accidentally triggers a simulated scenario of nuclear Armageddon, which is mistaken for the real thing. The computer ultimately learns that for nuclear deterrence, “the only way to win is not to play.” If AI disrupts the central logic of nuclear deterrence, as understood by the nuclear powers, or fundamentally changes the underlying assumptions that support it, the strategic consequences could be far-reaching, and the prospects that computers will learn “not to play” uncertain.43 There are several potentially destabilizing aspects of AI worth exploring: Increased Risk of War: AI may be seen as eroding mutual strategic vulnerability and thereby as increasing the risk of war. The combination of exquisite ISR with an effective defensive shield could make it tempting to conduct a disarming, decapitating or blinding first strike at strategic targets, including nuclear command and control (NC3), early warning radars, or dual-capable missiles and aircraft.44 Such a revision of deterrence logic could be highly destabilizing. Shared vulnerability and assured retaliation are central concepts of mutually assured destruction (MAD) deterrence theory. Switching the theoretical incentive from MAD to improve the odds of successfully conducting a disarming first strike could change the risk calculus that has formed the basis of strategic stability for decades.45 Preventing such a revision of nuclear deterrence logic was the essence of Vladimir Putin’s claim in March 2018 that his new weapons are “invincible against all existing and prospective missile defense and counter-air defense systems.”46 By evading perceived U.S. global strike and missile defense capabilities, Putin’s new AI-guided retaliatory forces are intended to preserve MAD. Additionally, if the weaker state believes a stronger adversary is actually positioned to strike first due to AI-fueled advantages (that will likely remain opaque and ambiguous due to their digital nature), they may want to lash out first in various ways (think Pakistan or DPRK).  Deterrence and Strategic Parity: No one country can gain all of the benefits of AI while denying them to potential adversaries. Competition to gain advantage will bring uncertainty about the future balance. Russia, China, and other nations’ advancements in these same AI-enabled technologies has the potential to shift the strategic calculus as well, especially in regional contexts. For example, while Russian and Chinese A2AD systems designed to defeat U.S. regional forces may reduce U.S. allies’ confidence in American security guarantees to protect them, the ability of the U.S. to defeat those A2AD systems with AI-accelerated ISR, BMC3I, defensive systems, and autonomous vehicles would demonstrate resolve and provide opportunities for joint U.S.-allied defense cooperation, thereby enhancing stability and deterrence. Reinforcing regional conventional deterrence is also an essential part of strategic stability.47 However, even the perception of an imbalance that favors striking first can lead to misperception, miscalculation, and arms racing. Whatever advantages can be attained with AI are likely to evoke countermeasures that mitigate temporary unilateral advantages, with all the incumbent opacity and AI safety risks referred to above. Flawed Data: AI systems are vulnerable to flawed data inputs. In her book Weapons of Math Destruction, data scientist, Cathy O’Neil, demonstrates how AI algorithms distort reality and lead to incorrect, misleading, and unjust decisions.48 Perhaps the biggest obstacle to increasing reliance on AI is the age-old problem of data reliability. AI can magnify the “garbage in, garbage out” problem.49 Data comes from many places and is not always carefully collected or curated, particularly as industry-driven innovation competes in a race-to-the-bottom for market share. Compounding the problems with the data itself leading to skewed results, AI often reflects human bias,50or creates new biases based on flawed “learning” from the data provided.51 Computer Vision: The AI-informed object and pattern recognition software behind Project Maven and many other applications — is relatively easily fooled by misleading data.52 Differentiating between similar objects is difficult,53 and more challenging with denial and deception campaigns, such as the use of camouflage and decoys. Even when data seems accurate, AI sometimes “hallucinates” things that do not exist.54 Transferring these inherent problems of data reliability and interpretation onto the battlefield raises critical questions about the safety and reliability that comes with the desirable qualities of speed and lethality. Accidentally hitting the wrong targets, for example, could have strategic consequences. Data Manipulation: Countering many AI applications can be simple and straightforward. Adversarial manipulation of data (image, text, etc.) provides many opportunities for mischief and mistakes.55 The fact that AI is easily deceived invites efforts to counter the sought-after military benefits.56 By corrupting data in calculated ways, it may be possible to cause catastrophic equipment failures, miscommunication, confusion, logistical nightmares, and devastating mistakes in AI-reliant systems. Additionally, these challenges can be compounded by the “black box” problem of not understanding how and why AI makes decisions also means that it would be hard to recognize if data had been compromised to produce inaccurate outcomes, such as hitting the wrong targets or misdirecting U.S. and allied forces. Ineffective Crisis Management: Speedy decision-making and operational execution may not serve well the goals of effective crisis management. On October 19, 1962, only three days into the Cuban Missile Crisis, General Curtis LeMay counseled President Kennedy, “I just don’t see any other solution except direct military action right now.” 57Ten days later, the crisis was resolved diplomatically. If one of the advantages of AI is the speed it adds to decision-making, that same speed could be a disadvantage if it accelerates the escalation of conflict from crisis, to war, and even potential nuclear confrontation.58 The battlefield advantages of AI-driven ISR and autonomous systems could shrink the time available for diplomacy to avoid or manage crises. As currently conceived, AI-driven battlefield systems would not include real time reporting and analysis of national and international diplomatic efforts to avoid, control, contain, or end a conflict — violating Clausewitz’s principle of war as “the continuation of politics by other means.” In many cases, logic might dictate striking first, as General LeMay advised. Accelerated decision-making might have pushed the Cuban Missile Crisis toward dangerously different outcomes. In practice, slowing things down can be the key to victory, especially when the stakes involve nuclear weapons. The fact that this accelerated information in the hands of decision makers is likely to be derived from insecure and unsafe AI-based systems even further exacerbates the command and control conundrum: how much risk and what systemic error rates are acceptable when contemplating nuclear war, and what are the signaling mechanisms in this theoretical hyper-speed future? Ineffective Joint Operations: AI may be unhelpful in trying to solve the main problem confronting U.S. military forces: effective joint operations. Such operations are always challenging, even for the most advanced military in human history. AI-supported weapons, platforms, and operating systems operate according to custom-built software and hardware that is specifically designed for each separate problem, system, and purpose. There is currently no overarching mechanism to integrate scores of AI-powered systems operating on multiple platforms.59 To get the desired effects of multi-domain ISR, it is necessary to integrate across scores of sensors, radars, weapons, and communications systems operating in multiple geophysical domains. If this were not challenging enough, those systems would be built and operated by different agencies, commands, and contractors, with different authorities, procedures, and operational cultures. Adding allies with their own AI systems to this landscape brings further complexity and risk. Designing a multiplex of AI-informed platforms that have the ability to communicate with one another in real time requires a new generation of data fusion, integrative software, and command architectures. Moreover, pulling all these pieces together to develop a holistic threat assessment that provides policymakers with strategic warning will not happen naturally. Instead, this task will require Herculean efforts to collect and analyze information “owned” by diverse stakeholders. Inter-service rivalry when it comes to AI has already begun to take root, and has severely complicated efforts to streamline the acquisitions, technology, and logistics process within the U.S. Defense Department. It remains unclear how these internal cultural challenges may play out in a more authoritarian environment such as Russia or China. Developing a fully integrated system capable of providing strategic warning in the United States, however, will clearly take many years. Unexpected Results: The close operation and integration of multiple AI systems, as required on the battlefield, can be expected to have unexpected results. The flip side of stovepiped systems not talking to each other is the issue of unexpected convergences. It is uncertain how separate AI- infused platforms might interact with one another, as various AI-guided systems operate in shared battlespace. Unknown outcomes resulting from friendly interactions are likely to be compounded by interactions with foreign AI systems. With so much uncertainty about the internal “black box” mechanisms that produce AI outcomes, AI to AI interactions are likely to produce unanticipated and unexplainable results, like choosing the wrong targets.60 Lastly, we cannot anticipate how AI will converge with other technologies, such as quantum computing, electromagnetic pulses, IoT, 5G, or blockchain/distributed ledgers. Potential convergences could produce strategic surprises that confuse and confound friends and foes alike, making the fog of war even more impenetrable. Human-Machine Coordination: Whether or not there is a human in the loop, the loop is getting crowded. The interface between humans and machine–where the proverbial “man in the loop” is supposed to exert human control–also raises critical questions about decision-making authority and organizational hierarchies.61 Within the military, questions of rank, service branch, and responsibility for lethal actions can be contentious in the best of times, as illustrated by the debates over authority for U.S. drone strikes.62 With scores of AI-informed battlefield systems operating at breakneck speed, each connected to its own chain of command, coordination among the humans who are in the loop of fast-moving battlefield operations spanning multiple adversaries, domains, agencies, clearance levels, contractors, allies, and organizational cultures will be challenging, especially if the goal is to maintain offensive advantage via speedy decision- making. Budgets, reorganizations, access, personalities, and leadership changes may have as much influence over AI capabilities as the technology itself. There will be lots of people in the loop in lots of places, each influencing how AI contributes to separate and shared objectives. Achieving strategic effects will require extraordinary cooperation and communication — again, a complication that a more authoritarian adversary may or may not also be grappling with. Public Perception: It is hard to predict how the public will respond to AI in the military. AI algorithms are a central component of cyber influence operations aimed at shaping public perceptions. By now it should be understood that the use and misuse of electronic media to manipulate public perceptions, including the use of fake news, cyber bots, and deep fakes, can affect strategic stability.63 How the public views particular international conflicts can shape leadership decision-making, and can build or undermine support for issues of war and peace, especially in democratic states. AI powered tools such as cyber bots and deep fake technology could enrage or pacify public opinion, or mislead decisionmakers. Now that cyber conflict has become an ingrained feature of the international landscape, we should expect AI-fueled manipulation of public perceptions to affect crisis management, escalation, deterrence stability, and possibly nuclear decision-making. Accuracy in Decision-making: Decisions of war and peace cannot be left to predictive analytics. There are fundamental differences in the ways that data is used for scientific, economic, and logistic purposes, and for predicting human behavior. AI still cannot reliably predict the outcomes of sports contests, elections, or international conflict, at least within acceptable margins of error for making consequential decisions. Despite longstanding interest in predictive analytics that can tell decisionmakers what to expect before it happens, faith in the ability to predict incidence or outcomes of war and conflict based on big data machine learning is fraught with misplaced optimism.64 All of the potential dangers stemming from unreliable (outdated, biased, compromised) data, machine learning bias, and interpretation errors are magnified when human emotions, non-rational behavior, and inherent unpredictability cloud the data and the decisionmaking. The result is wider margins of error which may be acceptable for academic purposes, but do not satisfy practical and ethical demands of national security decisionmaking. Much like self-driving cars, where AI can correctly assess most–but not all–situations, 90% correct predictions could mislead decision makers and put soldiers and citizens lives at stake. Close is not good enough when it comes to war, especially where nuclear risks are involved. Nation states, however, are moving forward with integrating these AI-techniques into their militaries and command structures. While the United States, China, and Russia move to integrate these technologies into their militaries, there remains a paucity of research and understanding regarding the cumulative risk inherent to large decision support systems that rely on these technologies not just to potentially provide predictions and recommendations–but also will be responsible for an increasingly large percentage of the information provided to decision-makers through the command and control enterprise. While flawed predictions may present an unacceptable scenario with horrific potential outcomes, an entire ecosystem built on unsafe and unpredictable AI-fueled systems quite simply remains an un-investigated and under-appreciated element of the potential risks inherent for strategic stability and nuclear deterrence. Public Sector-Private Sector Tensions: public-private partnerships shape the future of AI, but war remains the preserve of the state. As a dual-use technology, AI is freely available to everyone. It is being developed and applied beyond the reach of governmental controls. Like many other dual-use technologies, governments rely on the private sector for the underlying research and development, software, hardware and expertise required for AI to be used for military purposes. DOD and the intelligence community have deep ties to Silicon Valley and have doubled down on efforts to expedite the acquisitions process, especially for cyber and AI.65 What this means in practice is that many countries will use the same experts, companies, and global supply chains to support their military AI aspirations, creating potential competitive conflicts of interest and security vulnerabilities related to sharing intellectual property. This dynamic is already evident in the global marketplace, where Google and other companies have found it advantageous to accommodate Chinese demands on censorship and surveillance,66 while simultaneously expressing political opposition to supporting U.S. military AI projects such as Project Maven. Global technology companies will have to weigh the costs and benefits of serving some customers while keeping others at arm’s length. The U.S. government, however, has little choice but to remain heavily dependent on the private sector to develop and implement AI strategies, while also competing with adversaries who are not constrained by the separation between public and private. China, for example, continues to move forward with haste.67 AI’s Potential Effects on Deterrence With these potential destabilizing effects in mind, how could AI alter the fundamental calculus of deterrence? ​At the top of the list of AI applications that could have true strategic significance is the likely increased risk of surprise attack. The combination of effective defenses with exquisite ISR that makes it possible to locate mobile targets and strike them with speed and precision raises long- held fears of a “bolt from the blue” first strike. While the fundamental logic of deterrence is unchanged, perceptions that an adversary has sufficient intent and capability to conduct such a preemptive attack on vital assets motivates a variety of counter measures. Evaluating the incentive to strike first evokes memories of Pearl Harbor, in which the U.S. underestimated Japan’s risk calculus while fully recognizing Tokyo’s military capacity to launch a cross-Pacific raid. AI contributions to military and intelligence capabilities do not override political considerations — with an important caveat added for the possibility of AI-fueled manipulation of public attitudes that could distort political judgement. Avoiding and deterring conflict remains a paramount responsibility for national leaders. Slightly improved odds of eliminating all but a few of an adversary’s strategic weapons, and shooting down any surviving retaliation with missile defenses, still involves catastrophic risks, and does not even begin to answer questions about the aftermath of such a conflict. Nevertheless, possessing the theoretical capability to conduct a disarming first strike inevitably triggers a classic security dilemma, which is guaranteed to provoke counter measures from those threatened by enhanced striking power. Further advances in defenses against counterforce strikes would be a predictable response, as well as hardening and camouflage to evade and confuse exquisite ISR. Asymmetric capabilities to undermine said advantages also will arise, with cyber an immediate domain for consideration. To the extent that AI influences perceptions of intent and capability, and alters the calculus of risk and reward, it will inspire new thinking about possible offensive and defensive maneuvers in the Evolution of Nuclear Strategy.68 AI and Regional Stability How could AI-assisted weapon systems affect regional stability, including U.S. allies? Widespread deployment of AI-supported ISR platforms is likely to affect regional stability in the five to ten year time frame. While the United States remains the leader in translating AI to currently deployed platforms, China and Russia are not far behind.69 Many U.S. allies are advancing their own AI capabilities, albeit with significant constraints. Initially, however, the speed and lethality gained from AI-informed situational awareness and battle management systems is likely to provide the United States and its allies with options for countering Russian and Chinese A2AD. The coming architecture of ISR, BMC3I, and defensive systems appears well positioned to give net advantages for U.S. and allied regional security alliances. In addition to tactical military benefits, co-development of multi domain ISR provides opportunities for collaboration that directly address threats to allied security, especially with respect to extended deterrence relationships with key allies in Asia and Europe. Strengthening regional conventional deterrence and regional extended nuclear deterrence reduces incentives for risk taking and supports broader interests in strategic deterrence. AI applications that support these objectives will have beneficial effects for strategic stability. Strategic AI Competition, Arms Racing, and Strategic Stability How will competition in applying AI to military missions affect strategic stability? Global competition in military AI continues to intensify. A general consensus is forming indicating that an AI arms race is underway. Whatever advantages are possible in the near term, however, may be short lived, as U.S. allies, major adversaries, and a multitude of rising powers incorporate AI into their political and military strategies. In light of the rising tide that is advancing AI prospects around the world, temporary advantages are unlikely to yield lasting military predominance. For example, China and Russia will eventually possess their own versions of multi domain ISR coupled with precision strike and layered defenses. How will these capabilities influence Beijing’s thinking about the U.S. role in the South China Sea, or Russian assessments of NATO’s defense of the Baltics? These are not primarily technical issues. AI is enhancing the performance of many tactical and strategic systems, but not giving definitive unilateral advantage to anyone. The conduct of warfare is changing, and AI is fueling many of those changes, but it remains to be seen if the calculus of deterrence will remain steady. While competition that retains a balance of power can be stabilizing, the accompanying uncertainty has historically led to miscalculation and great power conflict. Unintended Consequences and Strategic Surprise What are the risks of unintended consequences and strategic surprise from AI? Predicting the future impact of technology is a risky business. We know with certainty that AI is being incorporated into a wide array of military missions with the intent of improving our knowledge of the operational environment, an adversary’s capabilities, and the speed and precision of offensive and defensive weapons. We can usefully speculate about how these developments are poised to change the face of modern warfare and how those changes might affect regional and strategic deterrence stability, based on our understanding of established political and military realities. More elusive, however, is a clear picture of how AI might converge with other technologies to produce unexpected outcomes or “unknown unknowns.” Nevertheless, several possibilities that could have major strategic consequences and alter the underlying realities on which regional and strategic stability are founded: ​Questions to Consider Moving Forward This paper covers a wide range of topics without delving deeply into any particular question. Further research is required to fully comprehend the potential risks and rewards of AI in military operations. They include: What are the implications of integrating AI into military decision-making? The national security community is beginning to understand the capabilities associated with novel AI-techniques, but there is very limited understanding of the compounding risks posed by the inherent safety and security challenges that these novel techniques face. Research remains necessary on examining the implications of an entire decision support system that is providing advice to a military commander that cannot actually be understood. Further research also remains necessary about what is considered acceptable error and risk thresholds, and whether/how these systems compound risk, or how they may be distinct. How risky are the vulnerabilities inherent to AI-related technologies in the military context, and are we able to tolerate or eliminate those risks? Several instances already exist in the private sector of AI-related technologies exhibiting bias or failure. While the harm created by faulty chatbots and self-driving cars can be contained, how and to what extent can AI create problems in the military context, especially when critical military decisions are made based on AI systems or even made by AI systems? Do militaries have adequate safeguards for AI errors, and are such safeguards even possible given the speed and pressures of warfare? How will the military handle primary safety and security challenges of AI, namely issues like adversarial examples, data poisoning, reward hacking, and data protection? Are military leaders providing adequate guidance to personnel on how to use and safeguard AI systems? When designing and utilizing an AI system, when do you trust the human over trusting the machine? Many people are concerned with the “singularity” where AI surpasses human cognition. However, this is not how AI currently works. Cognition isn’t a straight line but rather a complex, multidimensional process. Are there cognitive functions or combinations of functions where humans will always be superior? In areas where AI might surpass human cognition, like deductive reasoning, how and when do we decide “trust” its decisions within a military system? When should a human be “in-the-loop,” “on-the-loop,” and “out-of-the-loop?” Will humans be pushed out of decision-making altogether? Additionally, super-human performance associated with AI likely means counter-intuitive decisions. How would do react to those decisions? How well can humans trust machines that cannot explain their recommendations — especially in a military context? Scenario-based exploration of these questions will illuminate new answers. Can AI empower unstable or non-state actors with few resources? AI allows militaries to perform labor-intensive work with much less manpower and at significantly lower costs. It also gives militaries the ability to perform more tasks with less resources. But are these same benefits already lowering barriers to entry for unstable regimes or non-state actors to build their own AI capabilities, and will they do so in the future? How Do We Successfully and Safely Integrate AI into Military Operations? Integrating AI-related technologies into military operations requires training, hiring technology-savvy people on the ground, and ensuring coordination and interoperability between multiple systems, products, and technology across the world. What can we do to ensure that AI-related technologies are safely integrated into military operations given these implementation challenges? Can we ensure the accuracy/security of data sets? Furthermore, algorithms and deep-learning tools are dependent on clean, accurate data sets to train or improve their capabilities. But there have already been instances where algorithms, bots, and data sets were hacked or poisoned, and there would be dire consequences in the military setting where such attacks would impact troop movement, weapons deployment. What kinds of safeguards and precautions need to be in place to prevent such incidents, and, again, are such safeguards even possible? Conclusion Evolutionary changes in the logic of regional and strategic deterrence are not new, nor are they necessarily harmful to U.S. national security. Efforts to integrate AI-based technologies into U.S. defense and intelligence strategies illustrates the continued innovation and competitive advantages sought in support of U.S. national security policy. Recent changes in U.S. deterrence posture may not end up undermined by these developments in AI, at least in the near term.70 However, the rapid expansion of AI military applications across the globe merits a high level of focused attention to minimize its negative impacts on strategic stability, and to prevent strategic surprise. As states and non-state actors being to deploy a broad range of AI-techniques in weapons systems, command and control, and decision support systems, the fundamental assumptions underlying survivability and credibility may well be called into question over time. As with previous eras of significant evolutionary change in the conduct of warfare, prudent planning and novel strategic frameworks combined with intense diplomatic engagement will be required to prevent destabilizing effects from these novel techniques. Finally, a deep integration of verification and validation of the safety and security of AI systems must be a pillar of planning, programming, budgeting and execution of defense acquisition processes going forward. Without this in place, the vulnerabilities created by these new technologies in and of themselves could lend to significant destabilizing trends. Adding additional machine fallibility to human imperfection seems a perhaps unwise endeavor, and will require greater systematic research and understanding of the implications of these novel techniques in relatively short order.

Try it…  Render Network Follow Render Network -- Listen Share Dear RNDR Community, More than a month into the RNDR Mainnet, we are excited and happy to see users rendering scenes on our network and getting RNDR miner rewards fulfilled in real tokens. As we release more features, we wanted to share with the community more information about the economics of the RNDR network and how it flows through various points on the platform. A core question for the network is how the specific rendering power of a token will shift with changes in the market price of rendering. Naturally, when you have users buying and selling tokens in order to utilize the platform and render projects on the network, you will have a consistently changing underlying price of the token. This could be problematic for users that require rendering services on a consistent basis, or for miners looking to have a consistent and predictable inflow of RNDR for their work. Both artists and miners need to forecast costs to effectively use the network. RNDR Multi-Tier Pricing One solution that we have been working through internally to minimize this uncertainty for users and miners is a process that we call Multi-Tier Pricing (MTP). MTP allows users to select what Tier of power they want their job to be processed based on parameters like speed, system specs, and security. The pricing for each tier will be stable but periodically adjusted for changes in GPU performance, GPU cloud rendering costs, and decentralized supply and demand data. For example, adjustments will be made for new OctaneBench releases and successive GPU hardware generations. The Reason for Multi-Tier Pricing When designing RNDR, an overarching economic goal is to clear as much GPU compute supply and demand as possible, maximizing overall use of the network. In economic terms, we want to eliminate deadweight loss — when supply and demand are mismatched, leading to unproductive waste. Monopoly or distorted pricing, the cause of deadweight loss, occurs when producers set prices artificially high to extract rent or when pricing does not effectively capture demand. Blockchain peer-to-peer marketplaces offer remarkable opportunities to reduce this type of waste and generate new forms of economic productivity. For RNDR, GPU cloud rendering needs to become democratized in order for next generation holographic media creation to scale. Multi-Tier Pricing helps all sides: artists don’t forego cloud rendering due to high costs and miners minimize idle GPU time. RNDR Multi-tier pricing efficiently matches supply and demand by creating a set of preferences that users can choose from to best suit their rendering needs and price elasticity. Artists with inelastic preferences — for example, time pressures like a critical deadline or highly-complex scenes that can only be processed with specialized hardware — will be able to have their demand met using a higher tier of nodes with priority. Meanwhile price sensitive artists, who mainly want cheaper GPU cloud rendering options, will have the ability to get work done at highly competitive rates as nodes become available on the network. When both elastic and inelastic demand is met on the network, RNDR maximizes use on the network. Further, premium tiers reward the creation of services that some artists need like high performance GPU clusters and more secure node configurations. With supply and demand efficiently clearing at maximum network usage, RNDR creates a sustainable multi-sided GPU rendering marketplace. A Multi-Sided Network In order for RNDR to sustainably grow, it needs to balance both artist and miner interests. For example, if pricing did not allow miners to pay their hard costs like electricity and infrastructure expenses, there would be no one to process rendering jobs for artists. Similarly, if rendering was too expensive or slow for artists, there would be no jobs on the network for miners to process. Keeping these interests in balance over the long term is the goal of the network’s economics. There are a number of heuristics the team is working with in order to create a sustainable equilibrium. The first is that miners need to process rendering work above marginal costs, allowing them to pay electricity and operational costs with sustainable operating margin while on the network rendering jobs. As part of our marginal cost calculations, we are including GPU infrastructure (see Figure 3). While it is debatable whether these are sunk costs or not, and whether they should be considered marginal costs, we want the network to function sustainably over the long term, allowing miners to upgrade to the latest generation of GPUs. Because GPU upgrades create better supply and a more productive network for artists, we are including GPU hardware in marginal cost. On the artist side, we want ultra high resolution unbiased cinematic GPU path-traced rendering to become more accessible across the industry. We want to remove trade-offs between speed, quality and resolution — providing artists the ability to scale to the cloud with reduced cost and time pressures. Below is an overview of how the network achieves these goals through MTP. Multi-Tier Parameters In this example, you can see the ascending Tiers as the relative cost and power for each Tier increases from Tier 3 → Tier 1. If you are an artist that doesn’t need the work to be completed quickly, you can choose a Tier 3 iteration of a job, which would cost less than a comparable Tier 2 and Tier 1 iteration, all things equal. We aim to provide a solution to the problem of different needs by giving users a choice to pay different amounts based on what they are looking to get out of their specific render job. [A Note on Tier 1 OB Adjustment]: Tier 1 reflects the initial RNDR pricing based on OctaneRender Cloud (ORC) secure GPU cloud rendering costs. As you can see in Tier 1, we are adjusting the equation for 1 RNDR so that it can be easily normalized to €1 and an hour of OB work, helping artists easily calculate rendering costs. We are also updating the amount of work artists get for 1 RNDR to reflect the latest efficiencies in OctaneBench 4, which is about 10–15% faster on Pascal GPUs and 25–30% faster on Turing/Volta. The adjustments do not substantially change the price of RNDR, they are focused on updating RNDR for OctaneBench 4 as well as intended to make cost calculations easier — i.e. 1 RNDR = €.25 of rendering work at 25 x OB4*H and €1 of RNDR work = 100 x OB4*H. On the miner side, we will be implementing node specific factors for Tiering. Examples of the factors that we may potentially include are: Total System OB, Node History (Successful % of jobs processed), minimums for VRAM and RAM. These figures will be processed and combined through a Composite Score system, similar to our Reputation Score. We are currently working on releasing a User Manual that will explain this further, but wanted to share this with the community as a primer for the upcoming documentation. Below is an example table to go along with Figure 1: As we work to provide a way for miners to exchange tokens in order to cover basic energy costs, we have developed a tool to assist with the power consumption mechanics and costs associated with rendering. We are currently working to release this tool to the public; in the meantime, here is a simple example screenshot of the calculations and expected output of the figures. These figures help us calculate operational costs that need to be accounted for token pricing. For simplicity we assume 100% GPU energy utilization at full TDP and the global average electricity price of $.12 kWh. Additionally, we will be ensuring the tool accounts for higher electricity costs, so that miners in those areas are not operating at a loss. This post is intended to preview some of the network economics that are designed to facilitate efficient peer-to-peer rendering. We will be releasing additional information in user manuals to support successive launches after we complete the Genesis Beta period.

When humanity began we used cave drawings as a way of communication and the technology that we have has remarkably evolved since then as it has been proven that robots could be taking over the jobs that we have in modern society now. Developments in the film industry regarding technology have been very successful, an example of this is Terminator 2 which was the first $100 million film which was released in 1991 (The Numbers, 1997.) This maybe the case due to the fact that people enjoy hearing things about the developments in technology because we are so fast in modern day society in regard to quick technological changes, for example Apple and Samsung release new models of phones every year- this is due to a very competitive market so they can outdo their sales from the other companies. However, we can’t say that every company is out to outdo their competition as there is simply too much demand for the company to bring out a new model every year. People are now putting their lives on to their phones, Apple and Android have now brought out software that keeps all of your ‘important’ things safe, these are called ‘The Cloud’ and ‘OneDrive’. This may sound like a good thing as you can’t lose anything that is saved on to your device, however, if your device malfunctions then you can find yourself completely stuck. Businesses that survived without the internet before can go back to the old-fashioned way of working i.e. on paper, howbeit some more modern businesses rely solely on the internet to run e.g. internet entrepreneurs would be at risk as they would be stuck if their businesses went through an internet catastrophe. Due to many workplaces relying solely on the internet and machines to operate for a successful days work, many people’s jobs could actually be at risk of being replaced by a machine that could do it for them. The BBC have a list of job roles that are likely to be taken over by robots, for example a medical practitioner’s role is very unlikely to be taken over by robots as jobs in the hospitality field have compulsory attributes that need to be shown in that particular job e.g. empathy- this is something which a robot cannot possess. In contrast to this a telephone operator for example would be at high risk of their jobs being taken over, this is because it is convenient for people e.g. a 24-hour service without the need of people staying for an early or late shift. However, this could cause problems with this job in particular as some people like to sort their problems out with people over the phone so they can see that their issue has been dealt with, a robot may not be able to identify the problem that a person may have as there will only be certain areas of knowledge that a robot can have. Although we see that the rise in technology is a good thing, there are some accounts that it could be bad for us to let a robot have a mind of its own. Microsoft released that they were going to set up a chatbot that would answer people’s questions without an actual human doing it. Everybody thought that this was amazing as we were developing our technology so quickly, but it took less than 24 hours for Twitter to corrupt the chatbot called ‘Tay’. Microsoft released a statement saying that “The more you chat with Tay, the smarter it gets.” (Vincent, 2016). The Chatbot absorbed all of the information that it could from online sources such as Twitter and became ‘racist’ and ‘homophobic’, Microsoft were then quick to discard of ‘Tay’ proving that robots were too dangerous to be left in a person’s job. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*pqel3jowCEGG2jd5, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*pqel3jowCEGG2jd5, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*pqel3jowCEGG2jd5"

In general, this only concerns the banking sector, which every day has a duty to help transactions and save money for customers. However, after the development of the digital financial system during this decade, many people began to move and use more the uses offered by the digital payment system. This arises from the great decision that businessmen took to apply the payment system with digital money. This indicates that the role of digital money has begun to gain public trust, even though its adoption has been judged to be still limited. In the payment system that uses digital money, the community must first have digital assets that can be obtained through purchase transactions or free of charge through air shipments, bonuses or other types of cash. ‘activities. To buy multiple types of digital tokens, users sometimes have to spend large amounts of cash due to the high price of chips. This is used by several malicious parties to exchange fake tokens. People still tend to question the concept of this system and how they guarantee the security they provide. Because people who want to have digital resources must first buy them, in this case, they must spend money according to the amount of chips they want. Therefore, security is considered a very important issue to consider and review so that users feel safe in transactions that use digital currencies and avoid the possibility of losses. The development of the digital financial system has now penetrated the world of business all over the world. Many suppliers of products and services have begun to rely on this digital financial system, which is presented in its application to the payment system. Some major providers are taking advantage of the digital money function by configuring a payment system that uses digital currency for each product sold. DigitalBits is developing a network that is based on technology partners, links or integrators, companies and donors. Partners in technology companies, integrators, service providers and companies can join the DigitalBits network. They can use the DigitalBits installation to present the technological products or services they provide within the DigitalBits network. In addition, they will also benefit from other benefits, such as obtaining a digital wallet, speeding up the payment process, a reliable security system and many other benefits. Technology partners can expand their offerings that will be integrated with the blockchain technology of DigitalBits. For integrators or interlocutors, DigitalBits will also provide them with special facilities and benefits, such as the ability to take advantage of blockchain technology to store all the transaction data they provide through suppliers and hosting centers. of the data. This is done to help new users connect to the blockchain network and get several benefits they did not know before. DigitalBits wants to indirectly extend the application of the blockchain technology system and increase the number of transactions through digital currencies. This platform is committed through its vision of developing the economy through global digital tokens. This is by presenting to the public the benefits that can be achieved through decentralized block chain technology where the movement of digital resources is not limited. Entrepreneurs and third parties associated with external developers can easily develop digital applications that can be customized taking into account the provisions of the DigitalBits API and the SDK. This platform also provides a source code for digital wallet that can be used directly and easily to adapt to the creation of a digital wallet with a certain brand.

https://medium.com/digitalagenda/social-innovation-comes-of-age-ff736766532c?source=tag_archive---------184-----------------------,Social innovation comes of age,Published in DigitalAgenda,DigitalAgenda,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in DigitalAgenda Follow DigitalAgenda -- Listen Share Written by Geoff Mulgan, CEO, Nesta Social innovation is a lot more visible than a decade ago. There are funds, university research centres, offices in government, events of all kinds. The idea that societies need innovation as much as fields like medicine or science is becoming more mainstream. But it’s still very far from being embedded. In some parts of the world, the climate has become markedly hostile — the last thing authoritarian governments like Russia, Turkey or Brazil want is to fuel social creativity. But even the more benign liberal societies are much more comfortable supporting innovations in hardware than in society. The UK election is an obvious example. The big parties are competing with big promises to invest in physical stuff — roads, rail, bridges. But they have no policies or ideas on social innovation and few ideas on how to solve acute social problems other than by throwing money at them. The contrast with science is very striking. In the late 19th and 20th centuries science went through a remarkable transition. Before it had mainly been the province of enthusiastic amateurs — like Charles Darwin or Michael Faraday and long-forgotten inventors dreaming up new ideas in their sheds. But then it became much more of a system. Governments invested large sums in research laboratories and universities. Big firms like Du Pont and General Electric set up R&D labs. The shares of GDP devoted to R&D crept up, to around two per cent in countries like the UK and closer to four per cent in others like Korea and Finland. The result was the tide of new technologies that has changed every aspect of our lives. But rapid innovation in hardware was never matched by equally restless innovation in society, and the imbalance has continued. Large sums of money go to advancing aerospace or pharmaceuticals but much less to innovation in homelessness or isolation. During the 20th century society was increasingly left behind by technology and one important reason was that it had no comparable system for innovation, with significant financial and human resources devoted to incubating ideas, improving them and then taking them to scale (despite some pioneering efforts to promote social R&D by big foundations in the 1950s and 1960s). In the UK, for example, the big funding agency — UKRI — has no dedicated resources for social innovation or social R&D. The same is true of the US. France and Canada are beginning to shift — and Trudeau’s reelected government recently announced $1bn for social innovation. But they remain the exceptions. The internet is a good example of what goes wrong as a result of this imbalance. It is, of course, an extraordinary technology, the product of public R&D (at DARPA and then CERN) followed up by furious commercial innovation. But the years it became central to daily life were also years when the proportion of the US population that could count on anyone to support them in a crisis sharply fell (from 92 per cent to 75 per cent) and when a host of new pathologies arose, from the accelerated spread of fake news to compulsive behaviour. Very little money was spent on innovations directed to solving these pathologies, mainly because it was no-one’s job to do so. Too many of the pathologies of our times — from political alienation to inequality — are the result of this profound imbalance between those fields that invest heavily in innovation and those that don’t. The former include the military, surveillance, and much of business, including the click through advertising that dominates the platform economy. The latter includes almost everything to do with society. The World Happiness report earlier this year showed why this matters. It concluded that relationships explained more of the differences in well-being between nations than anything else. People’s answers to the question: ‘If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?’ — explained 34 per cent of the well-being score, more than income (26 per cent), or healthy life expectancy (21 per cent). But the systems governing R&D have barely started to reflect these patterns. For me, social innovation is the lens through which we can think about how to put this imbalance right. The problem is not a lack of good ideas, or creative people, or inspiring projects. The problem — as with science in the late 19th century — is the lack of a system that can help promising ideas evolve, develop and then spread. In my book I set out some of what such a system would and could look like, showing: how it taps into the energies of social movements and social entrepreneurs; how it experiments and incubates; how it generates capital to develop and scale ideas; how it connects to the power of government; and the role it can play in big challenges like the transition to a zero carbon economy. Today’s context makes it all the more urgent that these ideas become common sense. A fourth industrial revolution is driving change at breakneck speed — threatening millions of jobs; harvesting data without consent; and leaving people feeling like observers with little power. There is a clear parallel with the history of the first industrial revolution. In the first half of the 19th century industrial technologies and early capitalism developed at breakneck speed, but with often disastrous social and environmental consequences. Millions moved into cities that were wracked with poverty, ill-health, crime and pollution. In cities like Manchester, for example, death rates from diseases like smallpox and measles were four times higher than in the countryside. Then in the second half of the century social innovation slowly caught up. Public sanitation and water; universal education; a wider suffrage; trade unions; microcredit; adult education and many others reduced the harms and spread the benefits. Now, too, social innovation can help us shape another industrial revolution in ways that give us more of the benefits and fewer of the harms.

(It’s along the same lines as the make your own tea from scratch analogy used by Simon Wardley). Not sure if you know it but it goes like this: “Gardening materials, including the plot, seeds, and manure, cost $113; the plane ticket and boat rental to collect the ocean water was $351; the oil press parts cost $32; the chicken was $20; and miscellaneous items, such as pickle jars, cost him $44. He paid himself $7.25 an hour, minimum wage, and estimated that he had spent about 140 hours on the project. Adding all this up brings the total to $1,554.” https://fortune.com/2015/09/23/1500-sandwich-from-scratch/ So, as the argument goes, why would you spend $1554 making your own sandwich when you can buy one for $5 at a nearby cafe? This is an argument used in favour of bringing in a product like SAP or Dynamics or Salesforce, rather than building your own CRM or work management software or website. But it’s flawed. It’s wrong. And honestly, can easily be flipped on its head. I need to apologise for beating this analogy to death, but bear with me a little longer. Making your own sandwich from scratch in software terms is like building your own database, queuing system, programming language, servers and test framework. I’m not even going to mention building your own laptops. Obviously, what a ludicrous suggestion. Building custom software is more like (one last time, I promise/hope) going down to Tesco, buying your lettuce, tomato, cheese, bacon and bread. Then going home, frying your bacon, putting the ingredients together inside a toasted or fried bread — I don’t eat bacon so not sure what the optimum way is to make a BLT — and eat it when you are ready. £1 total cost for a sandwich that is made exactly as you need it to be. Building the right thing, the right way, at the right time. Building custom software is about making sure you get maximum value out of the effort put in. Doing it the way you need. Your business needs must drive the direction your software takes, not your software driving the direction of your business. Buying your own ingredients (sorry!) allows you to make your sandwich in the way you see fit. The vision for your company should not be limited by the vision or capabilities of your software. I started my career 20 years ago. Before Amazon was anything other than an online bookshop. Before “To google” was a verb. At a time when a quiet night in with your girlfriend involved a short walk to Blockbusters to pick up a movie. Things have changed. Our customers are not simply airline customers, utility customers, retail customers. They’re Amazon customers, Monzo customers, Netflix customers. They are very well aware of what can be done and they expect it to be done. In the environment we live in now, allowing your business to knowingly and intentionally constrain the direction it can take over the next 5–15 years is a real and dangerous dereliction of duty. While there is an appropriate time to use these enterprise juggernaut products…..actually, was trying to be balanced but was going to end up bullshitting you. With the right culture, people, technology and, most importantly, will, there is never an appropriate time to pick SAP or Salesforce to provide differentiating value to your business. In those circumstances where IT is simply the cost of doing business (e.g. finance) then maybe it’s the right way to go. Even then, if it’s simply the cost of doing business, shop around. Find the most cost effective way to do your business. There are fewer situations where software cannot be your differentiator. Fewer cases that you need to rely on a third party product with very expensive specialised consultants to make you better. I don’t need to go out to a restaurant to eat spaghetti. My homemade, custom cooked spaghetti with quality commodities is just as good. -- -- Technology strategist, helping large scale organisations transform into rapid delivery startup like entities and startup entities into large scale successes.

https://medium.com/@danielbmng/streaming-wars-lessons-from-the-console-wars-4ddf2b99e19?source=tag_archive---------123-----------------------,Streaming Wars: Lessons from the Console Wars,Written by Daniel Ng,Daniel Ng,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Daniel Ng Follow -- Listen Share “We earn consumer screen time, both mobile and television, away from a very broad set of competitors,” Netflix said in its Q4'18 shareholder letter. “We compete with (and lose to) Fortnite more than HBO . . . There are thousands of competitors in this highly-fragmented market vying to entertain consumers.” By calling out the video game Fortnite, which boasts 250 million registered users, Netflix made it crystal clear that it does not just want to be the number one platform for television content — it wants to conquer all forms of entertainment. Fortnite and the video game industry as a whole is actually an extremely useful lens through which we can analyze the current shift in today’s streaming landscape. As Disney, Apple, AT&T, HBO and Comcast (NBC) all launch their own streaming platforms over the next six months, looking back at this past decade’s battle to become the video game platform of choice can help us anticipate how the impending streaming wars will unfold. Having witnessed the console wars first-hand in 2014 as a product intern in Microsoft’s Xbox Division, the parallels are strikingly similar. 2013 marked a new era for console gaming: Nintendo had just unsuccessfully launched the Wii U the year prior, while Sony and Microsoft were gearing up to release a new generation of consoles — Sony’s Playstation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One. Console gaming is a classic razor blade business model; the short-term sale of the console guarantees the company’s future revenue streams for the next 5+ years, including a percentage of video game sales and monthly subscriptions to play online with friends. The good news for Microsoft in 2013 was that they had a head start due to their strong performance in the prior generation. At that point, the Xbox 360 had been the top selling console in the U.S. for 25 consecutive months, and Microsoft had an impressive 46 million Xbox Live members who each maintained a $9.99/month paid subscription to play online with others. This type of lock-in to the Xbox ecosystem was a huge advantage — if all your friends were on Xbox Live, you had no reason to purchase a different console. It seemed that Xbox Live’s network effects would surely give Microsoft the perfect tailwinds to capture the next generation of console gamers. Of course, this boldly assumed that Xbox 360 gamers would remain loyal to their current entertainment provider, Microsoft. And perhaps it was this assumption that emboldened the Xbox team to pursue a fairly aggressive launch strategy for the Xbox One, including: Despite all the goodwill that the company had accumulated over the years, Microsoft immediately lost favor with its core gaming audience. In fact, Microsoft ultimately reversed its stance on #2 and #3 to appease gamers, but the damage had already been done. Gamers flocked to the Playstation 4 — the console sold over 1 million units in less than 24 hours. Today, the Playstation 4 has sold 93 million units, more than double the number of Xbox Ones sold (42 million). In the end, gamers did not remain loyal to the Xbox brand, opting to side with the cheaper and more gamer-friendly Playstation 4. Netflix Implications: Given the recent announcements that competing services are going to market at prices significantly lower than Netflix (the standard subscription currently costs $12.99/month), Netflix needs to bank on more than customer loyalty to the service. With AppleTV+ at $4.99/month and Disney+ at $7.99/month, customers will now have plenty of cheaper options to choose from. (Note: Comcast and AT&T have yet to announce prices for their respective streaming services, Peacock and HBO Max). The impact of pricing pressure was evident in the last two quarters, particularly in Q2'19 when Netflix announced its first domestic subscriber loss since 2011. This is also coincidentally when Netflix increased their subscription prices. Since switching to different service providers is relatively painless and penalty-free, Netflix will need to be careful with the introduction of new cheaper alternatives. We’ve learned from the console wars that customers will vote with their wallets by putting their money where they get the most bang for their buck, regardless of the provider. Netflix has had a massive head start over rival streaming services with 152 million subscribers to date, including 60 million in the U.S. The closest competitor, Hulu, currently stands at a distant 28 million in the U.S. However, the real question is — does a first mover advantage really exist here? The conversations were similar at Microsoft when discussing the competitive landscape. In 2013, the industry was viewed as a two-horse race with Sony’s Playstation 4 seen as the only legitimate threat for the Xbox One. This was largely due to Nintendo’s complete flop with their console release (Wii U) in 2012. Gamers disliked all facets of the Wii U, resulting in Nintendo getting dominated by both Sony and Microsoft. Many in the industry wondered whether Nintendo even belonged in the console market anymore. Five years after that disastrous launch, Nintendo came back to the console market with the Nintendo Switch in 2017, which ultimately became the fastest selling console in U.S. history. Today, it is the top selling console in the market today (red line below). In August 2019, Nintendo had 47% of the month’s market share, Sony had 43%, and Microsoft finished with just 10%. When looking at lifetime sales, Microsoft is about to be surpassed by the Nintendo Switch by the end of the year, despite the Switch being launched 4 years after the Xbox One. Many of us believed at the time that Nintendo was so far behind in the race that they had no way of catching up to Sony or Microsoft. Instead, Nintendo managed to not only leapfrog both Microsoft and Sony in monthly sales, but also achieve the same total lifetime sales volume as Microsoft in half the amount of time. Netflix Implications: Looking back, we should have adhered to the widely shared belief in the gaming industry — “Never count Nintendo out”. While the Wii U may have been a complete miss, the company has been successful in the video game space since the ’80s. Netflix is similarly competing against experienced veterans in the industry with the likes of Disney, HBO, and NBC. Despite the massive following that Netflix has accumulated, it cannot underestimate its competitors’ abilities to rapidly attract an audience. After all, those competitors have honed in on that core competency since the ‘70s. The next natural question is, how did Nintendo’s Switch catch up to Sony’s Playstation 4 while the Xbox One remains so far behind? What differentiates Nintendo from Microsoft? The number one reason is content. Specifically, exclusive content. The primary motivation for gamers to pick one console over another is the ability to play particular games that are only available on that platform. If you really want to play Mario Kart at home, there’s no other way to do so but to purchase the Nintendo Switch. The key, then, to winning the console wars was to have a differentiated content strategy. Over the years, Nintendo has invested a lot of time building and developing their own characters, worlds, and franchises that have ultimately become household names (e.g. Super Mario, Zelda and Pokemon). They went back to their roots and created new games for the Switch featuring beloved characters, making it irresistible for customers to purchase the Switch. In August 2019, 5 of the top 10 best-selling video games were Nintendo-exclusive games. Contrast that with Microsoft where the top Xbox One games sold today are mostly games that you can play on any system, including the PlayStation 4 and PC. Unsurprisingly, video game publishers are generally unlikely to go exclusive with one platform because the revenue potential is much lower than selling on all platforms; the exception to this is when an exclusive partner is able to offer very attractive terms. Microsoft, however, is severely handicapped by their limited customer base, making publishers unlikely to give them an exclusive deal. Ultimately, the lackluster Xbox sales not only hurt short-term revenue, but also ruined their long-term strategy with developing differentiated content. Netflix Implications: With a finite budget for TV and entertainment, streaming customers will subscribe to the service that offers the shows and movies they’re most excited to watch — especially if that content is exclusively offered on that platform. The good news for Netflix is that their large subscriber base provides an exciting platform for content creators to partner with. The ability to showcase your work to as many people as possible is highly compelling. Their subscription revenue also allows them to be more aggressive when bidding for exclusive deals. The bad news is that the majority of content currently watched on Netflix is not actually original content that they had a hand in producing. Per below, more than half of the top 50 shows on Netflix are owned by the companies that are planning to launch their own streaming services. The grab for content is already well underway with NBCUniversal acquiring the exclusive rights to The Office and Parks and Recreation, while WarnerMedia acquired the rights to Friends. With Netflix losing its top 3 shows (and possibly more), will the company’s content portfolio be attractive enough to gain new and retain existing subscribers? The parallels between the streaming and console wars are hard to ignore. Given the similarities between gamers and streaming consumers, the path forward for Netflix will be a challenging one. Loyalty to a single platform does not exist. First mover advantages are negligible. And entertainment — whether it’s video games, movies, or TV — is ultimately a hits-driven business where the platform with the best and most exclusive hits will win in the long run. With new competing services entering the streaming wars, Netflix’s ability to compete will therefore largely hinge on whether they can develop a winning content strategy, which is far from guaranteed In my upcoming article, I’ll be diving deep into how Netflix’s content development strategy stacks up, and whether we should be optimistic or pessimistic about the company’s chances — stay tuned for Part II! -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*oluv_g_FEZSrL-I_.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*oluv_g_FEZSrL-I_.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*oluv_g_FEZSrL-I_.png"

https://medium.com/@carol_freire/touch-me-not-958d3e198ca4?source=tag_archive---------51-----------------------,Touch Me Not,Written by Carol Freire,Carol Freire,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Carol Freire Follow -- Listen Share It is time to broaden the conversation about physical contact and personal boundary. When my son was 3 years old, his preschool teacher reached out to me concerned about his habit of hugging his friends. With a serious tone on her voice, she informed me that she was teaching my son to respect other people’s personal space and to keep his hands to himself. I was puzzled by her comment, as I saw nothing wrong with a toddler’s display of affection towards his friends. At that time, I wasn’t aware that, as a Brazilian immigrant, my concept of personal space boundary was a bit different from hers. Although the concept of personal space is universal, different cultures have different perceptions of what constitutes personal space and how close is acceptable to stand to various acquaintances. In general, people from warmer climates are more likely to stand in closer proximity and engage in more touching during a conversation, probably because the hotter weather creates a friendly atmosphere. On average, Americans prefer to be 2–3 feet (60–90cm) away from acquaintances and strangers, while Brits like to keep 2.6 feet (80cm) from an acquaintance and just over 1.6 feet (50cm) from an intimate or close friend. This is in contrast to Argentinians, who keep a 2.4 feet (76cm) distance for a stranger, 1.9 feet (59cm) for an acquaintance and 1.3 feet (40cm) for a friend. Brazilians are also among the most touchy-feely people, as they greet each other with a kiss on their cheeks and frequently touch a friend’s arm or shoulder during a conversation. For Brazilians, and most South Americans, physical contact is seen as a positive, normal human interaction. Ten years after that conversation with my son’s preschool teacher, I find myself once again reflecting on the role culture plays on personal space, as I watch the controversy over Biden’s reputation for inappropriately touching women on and off the campaign trail. I don’t know much about Joe Biden’s life story to make an informed assessment of his behavior, and I don’t mean to minimize the women’s claim that they felt uncomfortable by Biden’s unwanted touches. I seek only to argue that, since personal space is heavily influenced by cultural and social factors, there is a need for a better understanding regarding physical contact and human interaction in our modern society. Of course context matters, and we do have rules about who we can touch, where, and when. But it is time to broaden the conversation about physical contact and personal boundary. Technology and social factors are fundamentally changing how we physically connect with each other and, to avoid turning America into a touch-phobic society, we must be open to a honest and holistic conversation about the rules of engagement and the direction we want to steer our society. Touching shouldn’t be such a taboo. Researches show that being touched or touching someone makes us healthier, happier and less anxious. It lowers blood pressure and heart rate, decreases levels of the stress-related hormone cortisol and increases immune function. A warm hug from a lover or friend floods our bodies with oxytocin, a bonding hormone that makes people feel secure and trusting toward each other, lowers cortisol levels, and reduces stress. Massage therapy has proven effective for depression, and neurotransmitters that modulate pain are stimulated by touch. In fact, we do a lot of self-touching all the time, by flipping our hair, massaging our foreheads, rubbing our hands or stroking our necks. Humans aren’t meant to live in isolation and physical touch is a fundamental necessity. Several studies have highlighted the pervasive effects of “touch deprivation” among kids, particularly those in orphanages, which can lead to a permanent physical and cognitive impairment, smaller stature, and social withdrawal later in life — which often includes aversion to physical contact. So, how can we reap the benefits of physical contact while ensuring personal boundaries are not crossed? I don’t have the answer. I only seek to incite the conversation. While culture shapes how we perceive personal space, technology is universally reducing the amount of time we dedicate to physical interactions. In our highly connected digital world, parents are doing less touching of kids, in large part because we are all glued to our phones and computers, interacting through a glass screen. Perhaps it’s no coincidence then that mental health issues have increased significantly over the last decades, stemming from the changing modes of social interactions caused by electronic communication and digital media. Regardless of age and culture, touch is vital to the positive health and development of human beings. We all need physical contact, the bonding that assures us we are not alone. Without the warmth of physical contact, which calms and unites us, we are denied one of the most primordial ways of communication and a sense of connectivity. When I stretch my arm and touch another human being, I show a desire to connect. When I cuddle my son, I express my love and forge a mother-child bond. When I extend my hand to help an elderly man cross the street, I show compassion and respect. And these moments of connection, while fleeting, have a lasting impact on our wellbeing. My son is now entering his teenage years and, although he is still not shy about expressing his love and affection to family and friends, he is spending more and more time behind screens. As a mother, I am faced with the challenge of getting him outside the digital world to build meaningful face-to-face interactions, with awareness and respect for other people’s feelings and personal boundaries. And I hope my son will encounter a world of tolerance and appreciation for genuine expressions of love, kindness and human connections. -- -- Curiosity leads my steps.

The problem remains interesting almost a decade later. Recently while driving to work I noticed several vanity license plates. I found myself contemplating how a computer could be used to decipher the meaning behind those plates. Plates reading NICEBODY and ATOYOTA seem easy to decipher because they’re just words without spaces. However, HYPRDRV (hyper drive) and TIH2 HO (mirror image of “oh shit”) are more difficult. Even more complicated would be plates like PD4BYEX (Paid for by Ex), W84ME (Wait for me). From the examples we just considered we can see that there are several types of challenges. Even the case that appears to be the simplest, words without spaces, is actually non-trivial. How do you know where one word begins and ends? One method might be to simply search for sub matches. For example, ATOYOTA would result in a match for the first character A, then TOY and later TOYOTA. NICEBODY, has NICE, ICE and BODY. Some plates such as PD4BYEX (paid for by ex) require searching for suitable character to word substitutions. We’d have to consider vowel removal: PAID resulting in PD and prefixes such as EX (ex-spouse). In an advanced solution words could be compared semantically to rank potential matches. Consider W84ME might result in [Wait four me], [W8 four me], [Wine 84 me]. Scoring would be higher for legitimate phrases. Legitimate phrases would be those which fared well against a Natural Language Parts of Speech tagger. The output of such a software program would still be a list of ranked potential matches. Meaning that the user would have to weed through results to select what they believe to be the most likely match. Another approach might be a search engine with a crowd sourcing option that allows users to contribute and select (possibly rank) potential solutions. The results of user interactions could be used to statistically train the search engine. If packaged into a mobile app this would be fun for those long family road trips. At a social networking extreme users could get social points for having spotted the most interesting vanity plates. I can just see the twitter post now: @Ryan just spotted IMABRAT (I am a brat) on I280. This would undoubtably require capturing license plate photos and having them uploaded to a cloud based server solution for character recognition, search and other backend processing.

This article will focus on these 2 characteristics — This is one of the most interesting stories I’ve ever read about in the field of programming. Just to start with let me go you through the story quickly: There were 3 soldiers, who are returning their home after a war. They were quite hungry so they reached a village in search of something to eat and kill their hunger. But soldiers found the doors locked & windows closed because villagers are short of food and they want to hoard what they had. Undeterred, the soldiers got an idea, they boiled a pot of water and placed 3 stones into it. Amazed villagers came out to watch what soldiers are doing. Soldiers explained to villagers that this is a “Stone Soup”. One of the villagers asked soldiers that “Is that all you put in?”. Soldiers said — Absolutely, but some say that it tastes even better if we put in few carrots into it. After listening to this a villager rushed away returning with a basket of carrots. A couple of minutes later, again a villager asked, “Is that it?” Soldiers said — “Well, some couple of potatoes can further enhance the taste.” Again a villager rushed to return with some potatoes, to be added to the soup. Over the next couple of hours, soldiers listed more ingredients that would enhance the soup, which makes different villagers ran off returning with an ingredient. At last soldiers removed the stones from the soup, and they sat down with the villagers to enjoy the steamy soup. Morals of Stone Soup Story — Be a Catalyst for Change But always remember the big picture — The Boiled Frogs Its a metaphor for the inability of the people to react to significant changes/events that occur gradually. The Boiled Frog has 2 scenarios — Moral — Don’t be like a frog. Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what’s happening around you, not just what you personally are doing. The phrase good-enough doesn’t mean sloppy or poorly implemented code. All systems must meet their system requirements to be successful. Normally while writing software for other people one should remember to get requirements from them. We should keep in mind that we’ve to ship software that satisfies the need for everyone involved in the system (end-to-end). We’re not advocating panic: it is equally unprofessional to promise impossible time scales & to cut basic engineering corners to meet the deadline. Rather the scope and the quality of the system are going to build should be specified as a part of that system’s requirements. Make Quality a Requirements Issue As an artist, if you paint a sketch and keep on adding details to the painting every now and then, then one day you’ll end up ruining the painting which you’ve started from scratch. So keep in mind that you shouldn’t end up spoiling a perfectly good program by overembellishment and over-refinement. There are some more key aspects of a Pragmatic Programmer, which I’ve discussed in the following articles: — The Cat Ate My Source Code (Part I) — Software Entropy (Part I) — Knowledge Portfolio (Part III) — Communicate (Part III) Inspired By: The Pragmatic Programmer — by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas -- -- Product Engineer @ Gojek (https://saumya.dev) Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*9In9bqo-iQzVKpm-LEiNwA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*9In9bqo-iQzVKpm-LEiNwA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*9In9bqo-iQzVKpm-LEiNwA.jpeg"

The new iPad Pro 2020 is now a reality. The optional “floating” stand with trackpad and mouse support sure does make the iPad look like a mini desktop. Apple loves to prime their customers. 2. The recently released Pro Display shows us that Apple is still dedicated to creating their own displays. While most of us aren’t able or willing to drop $5,000 on a computer monitor, we might consider something in the $1,000 range. It would be a great value if this display could be used for your MacBook and your iPad Pro. Imagine plugging your iPad into an ultra thin USB-C enabled display (made by Apple of course) and instantly, you have a desktop computer. Not just a mirrored image (doable right now with USB-C), but an optimized version of iOS fit for a desktop experience, all powered by your iPad (Pro).‬ ‪This would effectively be a brand new operating system (OS) that’s not quite iOS and not quite MacOS. Let’s drop the “i” in iOS and call this new operating system Apple OS: a screen-agnostic OS that works on any USB-C enabled monitor. You plug in your iPad, it detects the display, and feeds in this new OS.‬ ‪Apple OS gives you full usability ‬of every app on your iPad, but with a desktop experience — mouse and window support, right-click, etc. Apple has already been preparing for this feature for years. Here are 3 key changes: iOS apps on Mac: Apple has already created a “translation system” that allows iOS apps to work on the Mac and is pushing developers to optimize their apps for this change. These mobile apps will work on the MacOS software but the real value is showing how mobile apps would work on a bigger screen, one with a desktop (iPad + display) set up. One cord for everything: USB-C is standardized cable that can be used for video, audio, charging and data transfer all on one cord. Before USB-C, you often needed multiple cords to connect a CPU to a monitor. USB-C changes all that with one cord for everything. Apple hates cords (despite their recent dependency on dongles). They’ve accelerated USB-C standard adoption for their own products, swapping out MagSafe plugs on their MacBooks and the Lightning port on their iPads in favor of USB-C. They’ve also created a 3rd party market for USB-C computer displays, asking companies like LG to create USB-C enabled monitors for their high end Mac Pros. This all makes sense, even if its causing short-term pain (again, dongles ah), because plugging in your iPad to make it a desktop needs to be simple and intuitive. iPad is a Computer: Apple, with the release of the iPad Pro, has really pushed their users to view the iPad as a computer replacement. iOS 11 came with the Files app, better multitasking and a lot of power behind the screen. Apps like Photoshop now work on iPad with fewer limitations than ever. That’s a huge barrier torn down for designers to rethink how they use their iPads. Remember that “What’s a computer” commercial that everyone hated? Apple wants you to get rid of your computer in exchange for an iPad, even for those that need a desktop set up. What to expect: I think we’ll see two big releases in 2019 to help make iPad your next desktop. First, we will see an update to iOS 13 that will introduce Apple OS. Next, we will see two new displays from Apple, with two different price points. The first would be an update for the current Thunderbolt Display — a high end display built for Mac Pro users, possibly still using thunderbolt ports and other high end ports. The second display would be an ultra thin, edge-to-edge display equipped with only one USB-C port specifically for you to plug you iPad into it when you need a desktop to work on. This display would obviously be cheaper than the more premium Thunderbolt Display. But, of course, will probably still be pretty pricey. It’s still Apple, after all. -- -- Tech & Politics Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*btL7azKmNXe8ROROiDlf7g@2x.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*btL7azKmNXe8ROROiDlf7g@2x.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*btL7azKmNXe8ROROiDlf7g@2x.jpeg"

Many others around the world do not have the same experience as us. Just the amount and extent of technology in our lives is a major difference between us and teenagers who live in countries that are not as developed. The role of technology in our daily lives has evolved so much. To teenagers who do not have such advanced technology available to them, our lifestyle would seem extremely foreign. While technology can be a major advantage, it can also have negative impacts. Teenagers in the United States may seem to lead better lives due to greater access to technology. For one, many of us are able to communicate with our family and friends practically whenever we want and wherever we are. For example, if you take a survey from any class at our school, it is likely that all of the students have a cell phone. Perhaps a handful may not. This shows how even in a population of middle to lower income teenagers most people have technology that enables us to text, call, and even entertain ourselves. Teenagers that live in third world countries might have never even seen a cell phone before. On top of that, for those of us that live in places where the reliance on technology is very prominent, the need for people to create, maintain, and improve technology is also very high. This means a greater amount of job openings, more opportunities to make money, and the surrounding community’s enthusiasm to provide better education to teenagers. More technology means the need for people to work with and on technology. Generally speaking, the people who occupy these jobs receive higher pay. The government and other adults in our communities are more willing to provide education to students since technology is so important — it is not only a part of our safety, but is also a huge aspect of the economy. On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to technology having such a great influence on us. Social media, a result of the growth of technology use, seems to be beneficial: it brings people together, you can learn about current events around the world, and friends are able to keep in touch. However, it is known to lead to detrimental effects. This is more prevalent in teens. Our generation is so focused on taking perfect pictures to post, the status of others, simply trying to fit in, and live up to impossible expectations set by social media. We might not care too much about how we are living our life, but how others think we are living our life. While it can be beneficial, social media also has the potential to cause health issues like anxiety, depression, and stress. From personal experience, computers can also damage our health. Teenagers who do not have computers could arguably have better lives than those that do. I spend hours at a time on the computer. I could be doing anything from homework, studying for extracurricular activities, and even listening to music. In intermediate school I was on our Science Olympiad team and had to prepare for competitions in my free time. This meant researching, creating note sheets, and essentially having my eyes glued to the computer screen for extended periods of time. After that, I had to get glasses for reading and using the computer. The advancement of technology in our society has its benefits, but it also has negative side effects. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fill:88:88/0*Nx1Uvb4SvK75hlzv, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*Nx1Uvb4SvK75hlzv, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*Nx1Uvb4SvK75hlzv"

The developer homepage gitconnected.com && skilled.dev && levelup.dev Follow publication Omar Rabbolini Follow Level Up Coding -- 2 Listen Share Many, if not all, software engineering job adverts commonly found online list “good problem solving skills” as a requirement, and quite rightfully so. Problem solving skills are one of the key traits of great software engineers, and one that should be developed early in your professional life to pave the way to a successful career in the field. Before we look at how to get better at solving problems, let’s take a look at how Junior Engineer Me used to do it many years ago. To put it simply: I sucked. In the early 2000s, I got a job at a software house in London, working on a web-based report generation system. The engineering team was quite small, less than a dozen people in total, and the web team was even smaller, with just two of us covering both back-end and front-end development. Both my teammate and I were quite junior at the time. I had been working in web development for a couple of years at most, while Matt had graduated just the year before with a bachelor degree in Mathematics. One day, Matt sought my advice as he was trying to write a component to render a tree in the browser from information stored in a database. He had been going around in circles for a couple of hours already, and could not find an efficient way to translate the tabular data we had into a good looking tree. I quickly wrote a recursive function that would hit the database every time a node was visited. We tried it, and it worked. Matt was amazed at the speed I came up with the solution. Modern day me is horrified at the code that I wrote. Was my solution to the problem an example of good problem solving? No, not at all. The process of problem solving is traditionally divided into four steps: Furthermore, the step of devising the plan can be further divided into two distinct phases: The Research phase identifies preexisting solutions for problems similar to the one under examination and considers the pros and cons of each. Nowadays, this can be performed quite easily thanks to the slew of online resources available for this purpose (StackOverflow, Quora, Arxiv, etc.), somewhat shortening the time required to come up with a decent number of alternatives to solve the problem. The Adapt phase looks at optimizing the solution found so that it better fits our own problem. Sometimes, especially in the case where the research phase yielded poor results, this phase is more creative, and we might have to come up with a novel technique to satisfy our requirements. If we look at the story above, although the problem was simple and therefore the understanding of it was trivial, the mistake I made was not to do any research, and instead go for the first thing that came to mind. This meant creating code that worked at the unit-test level, but was destined to fail under load, which is what happened in practice. Therefore, the first take-away for improving one’s problem solving skills would be: Take your time to understand the problem and to research available solutions The more you practice, the quicker you can do your research, but in any case you should take as much time as needed to ensure you understand both the problem and the proposed solution, along with its strengths and weaknesses. I am going to say it again: time is important. This is why I hate giving brain teasers during engineering interviews: you can’t expect somebody to come up with, let’s say, a shortest path algorithm at point blank. Not everybody is Dijkstra. At most, brain teasers can give an indication of performance and creativity under stress, but do not offer any insight into any problem solving ability. Aside from rushing through the research phase, I found that most engineers (including myself) get stuck in the adaptation phase. There are two opposite cases here which frequently surface, especially when coming up with a completely new solution: Although opposite, these behaviors both stem from the same problem: subjective bias, or in other words: you are looking at your solution from a non-objective standpoint. Hence, the second take-away tip for improving one’s problem solving skills would be: When creating or adapting a solution, consider its merits objectively How do we do this? The best way is to implement and verify, as we saw earlier. However, we often do not have such luxury in software engineering as the implementation of each possible solution can be costly and excessively time consuming. What we can do instead is to create a spike and analyze its performance (a spike is the implementation of a mock-up / simplified version of the solution to explore its benefits). If this is not feasible, we can ask for opinions from other engineers to offset our own bias, bearing in mind that other engineers will have their own bias too! Let’s now take a look at the final two steps of the problem solving process. Implementation is inevitable, unless a valid solution could not be found and the project was aborted. Any improvement in this phase falls under coding skills and is therefore out of scope for this article. Verification, on the other hand, is often skipped as the team moves on to the next big thing straight after implementation is completed. This is a pity. The verification step can help the engineer to build their gut feel for good solutions, tying back with the “practice” point I made earlier on the topic of research. Therefore, our third take-away for improving problem solving skills is: Remember to learn from past experience Verifying your solution does not need to be a formal step to be done immediately after implementation. One can verify the effectiveness of their work some time after it is released, by keeping an eye on issues raised on the topic and / or any modification requested and developed. Code review feedback is also useful here, of course while keeping in mind the subjective bias point we saw earlier. The three tips we looked at so far are strictly related to the process of solving problems. There are many more things you can do to improve your problem solving skills, here are a few ideas: You do not need to limit yourself to solving problems at work. Consider joining an open source project and see how you can help there. This will also allow you to learn from other engineers outside your immediate circle, and get exposure to a wider range of problems. Although I do not like brain teasers during interviews, they are useful as a sort of gym for the mind when worked on in one’s own time. You can challenge yourself through coding exercises by using sites such as Coderbyte and HackerRank. Start from scratch, build a new app and open source your code. You can do this alone or in a group with other engineers, and grow together. Opening the source code can invite other engineers to comment on your decisions, further improving your problem solving skills. If you are out of ideas on apps to build, check out this list from Codementor for some inspiration. That’s it for today. I hope you enjoyed reading this article and that these few tips help you to up your problem solving game. Feel free to get in touch to let me know how you get on. Until then, keep on making good software! -- -- 2 Coding tutorials and news.

https://medium.com/@NYC_CTO/year-in-review-2018-at-the-mayors-office-of-the-cto-7a09fc31a32?source=tag_archive---------68-----------------------,Year in Review: 2018 at the Mayor’s Office of the CTO,"April 9, 2018: New York City awarded COSMOS Testbed in Harlem by the National Science Foundation (NSF)",NYC Mayor's Office of the Chief Technology Officer,No Author URL,N/A,12 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in NYC Mayor's Office of the Chief Technology Officer Follow -- Listen Share 2018 was a year of unprecedented growth for our office. Our team delivered on many initiatives that our City can be proud of and that the people that live here can benefit from for years to come. In my time as interim Chief Technology Officer, I am proud to look back on the work the team accomplished and wanted to share the highlights of our last twelve months, including NYCx Moonshot Challenges, Truth in Broadband reporting, privacy legislation, and new global coalitions, as well as touch on what’s ahead for 2019! 2019 will be a big year! I look forward to sharing some exciting updates in the coming weeks and partnering with you to make NYC the fairest and tech-equitable big city in America! — Alby Bocanegra, Interim Chief Technology Officer, City of New York New York and Salt Lake City were the first cities to receive funding under the NSF Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) initiative, with New York set to receive $22.5 million. Led by a consortium of academic, industry and community partners, the platform, called COSMOS, is a proving ground for a new generation of wireless technologies and applications. The COSMOS platform, anchored at Columbia University and City College in Upper Manhattan, will allow researchers and entrepreneurs from around the world to build and test new technologies that address the unique conditions of urban living and advancing a more connected city. The universities are working with public school teachers to develop curriculum for their classrooms that make use of the COSMOS testbed and technologies to teach science, technology, engineering and math. The COSMOS testbed will cover one square mile in West Harlem, with City College to the north, Columbia University’s Morningside Heights campus to the south, the Hudson River to the west, and Apollo Theater to the east. WHAT’S AHEAD: The consortium will complete the pilot phase of construction and launch the first experiments on the testbed. The City of New York’s first-ever Truth in Broadband Report empowers New Yorkers with information on the quality of internet service across the city, the availability of service options and the disparities that exist in both access and adoption across neighborhoods and populations. The Truth in Broadband: Access and Connectivity in New York City Report provides the most complete picture of broadband service yet presented in New York City. The report describes how broadband service stacks up against five principles the City uses to guide its actions and measure broadband service — equity, performance, affordability, choice and privacy. The report also exposes how data limitations and differing definitions of “broadband” pose challenges for assessing broadband access and connectivity in New York City. WHAT’S AHEAD: The Report will be updated with new findings in mid-2019. Mayors Bill de Blasio, Steve Adler (Austin, TX), and Ted Wheeler (Portland, OR) launched the Cities Open Internet Pledge to encourage mayors to take action against the repeal of net neutrality rules. Within a week of the announcement, over 20 cities signed onto the pledge agreeing to only do business with internet and telecommunications service providers that follow strong net neutrality principles.Today, 110 mayors representing over 25 million people have signed on to use their local authority to protect net neutrality. WHAT’S AHEAD: MOCTO is evaluating ways to monitor broadband performance and add transparency so that all New Yorkers can know they are getting the service they pay for. After launching a successful NYCx Co-Lab in Brownsville, Brooklyn in 2017, the Co-Lab, with support from the NYCEDC, launched in a second neighborhood:in Inwood/Washington Heights, Manhattan. This community driven, co-development program brings together local residents, non-profit and service providers, educators, and tech companies to help address community identified concerns with cutting-edge smart city technologies and new business models. Once together, the Co-Lab seeks to solve the neighborhood’s self-identified needs using these “innovative solutions.”. The expansion of Co-Labs builds on Inwood NYC, an multi-year neighborhood planning initiative to ensure affordability, modernize antiquated infrastructure, and promote economic development in the Inwood community. In late July, NYCx announced the Inwood advisory board comprising local leaders, civic entrepreneurs and nonprofit organizations dedicated to steering neighborhood-focused technology advancement and education programs in Inwood. WHAT’S AHEAD: The Co-Lab in Inwood will conduct further outreach to residents, potential local partners and host workshops to identify priority needs and introduce a call for tech and business models solutions to the challenges. The City of New York participated in Northside Festival as part of the Innovation lineup. Northside Innovation welcomes a vibrant community of startup founders, entrepreneurs, designers, journalists, VCs, marketers, and more across three days of keynote talks, interviews, panels, workshops and pitch competitions. At the Festival, NYCx hosted Accelerator Office Hours for MWBE entrepreneurs — 30 early-stage high-growth potential minority and women tech founders — to meet one-on-one, “speed mentoring” style, with 15 leaders from global and local tech accelerators (E.g., Galvanize, Grand Central Tech, EY, Humble Ventures, Stackpath, R/GA Ventures) who provided strategic insight and business development consultations for startups. 100% of participants met someone they would have not met otherwise and 84% of participants found the Accelerator Office Hours discussions to be useful to their businesses, and resulted in practical next steps helping to foster a diverse, inclusive infrastructure for New York City entrepreneurship. The Trust for Governors Island and the Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer announced the launch of free public Wi-Fi on Governors Island over the summer. The service is provided by Fiberless Networks, the winner of the Governors Island Connectivity Challenge, the first citywide ‘NYCx Moonshot Challenge.’ Fiberless Networks’ winning solution brings an important amenity to Governors Island’s growing audience of hundreds of thousands of seasonal visitors, vendors, arts and cultural programming partners and tenants. The technology delivered on Governors Island will serve as a test case for advancing broadband, Wi-Fi and 5G cellular service throughout the City. WHAT’S AHEAD: Fiberless has completed the first phase of network deployment on Governors Island as part of Phase 2 they will continue to expand to other areas of the Island including the East Development Zone. In partnership with TGI, NYCx will continue to glean feedback and insight from the network which will continue to inform the Office’s/ City’s Broadband Plan The second NYCx Moonshot Challenge, dubbed the Climate Action Challenge, called for submissions for the City of New York to test breakthrough technologies for charging electric vehicles. Announced in late 2017, in partnership with MOS, DOT, and DCAS, the challenge called on the tech industry to develop solutions for scaling electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure and accelerating the use of EVs citywide. In August, the winner was announced as German electric mobility company, Ubitricity. Jeremy M. Goldberg, Deputy CTO, NYCx, Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer said, “Ubitricity’s innovative solution could be instrumental in helping the City’s achieve its climate action goal while simplifying the needs of electric vehicle users and future adopters. I’m thrilled that the NYCx Climate Action Challenge surfaced a number of new technologies that have the potential to improve the lives of New Yorkers and future generations.” WHAT’S AHEAD: Ubitricity’s technology, which will be tested further in New York City over 2019, allows lampposts to be transformed with outlets into electric vehicle charging points that users can connect to with personally-owned smart charging cables that have built-in meters. This technology has the potential to enable the City to deploy curbside vehicle charging more quickly, with lower cost, and with less street clutter than other approaches. In March 2017, the NYCx Brownsville Co-Lab program formally kicked off with a series of advisor workshops and community forums aimed at expanding local knowledge of smart city approaches, urban data science, and technology prototyping. The NYCx team facilitated eight workshops for community advisors, each focused on a tech topic. Then two community forums took place where advisors led the community discussion to identify and prioritize top community challenges that tech can help solve. In 2018, the Challenges were brought to life . The first Challenge, “Zero Waste in Shared Space.” NYCx Co-Labs developed an integrated plan with New York City Sanitation Department (DSNY) and New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) for a 6-month test of a technology that increases community engagement of zero waste initiatives in public housing and facilitate onsite processing of food waste into compost. The system was introduced at Brownsville Houses, a NYCHA development with over 1,300 families, on July 12, 2018. New York does not currently have a citywide plan for how to provide organics service at NYCHA so this is a crucial test for the City to be able to deliver on organics in large residential developments. Two community organizations, Mothers on the Move and EcoRich, LLC., are leveraging this pilot towards creating advancement opportunities to NYCHA residents in the green collar economy. The second Challenge called “Safe & Thriving Nighttime Corridors” sought solutions to increase nighttime activity in community corridors in Brownsville. NYCx Co-Labs developed an integrated for a 6-month pilot of an intelligent pedestrian lighting solution and a solution for digital activation of public spaces from proposals by Ville-luminate the Block, a Brownsville-based partnership, and Anyways Here’s the Thing, a Brooklyn-based design studio. WHAT’S AHEAD: The pilots will activate in mid to early 2019 in Osborn Plaza and the Belmont Ave corridor in Brownsville. This is a crucial test for the City in terms of ‘nighttime design’ of public spaces throughout the City, especially where neighborhood safety issues are highest. City Council Intro. 1101 to City Council, introduced at the request of the Mayor, would establish the strongest privacy protections for cable broadband subscribers of any big city in the country. The proposed legislation would require cable providers to obtain consent from customers before they collect, use, or disclose personally identifiable information, ensure that privacy policies are available in languages other than English and accessible to individuals with disabilities, and give consumers the right to access and correct the data collected on them. Currently, internet service providers can track and sell user data without any notice or consent. The bill would also prohibit cable providers from refusing service, or penalizing, financially or otherwise, customers who do not consent. The bill would further mandate regular reporting, and provide mechanisms for customers and the City to hold companies accountable for violations. A companion bill, Int. 1102, would add further consumer protections and strengthen DOITT’s oversight of cable franchisees. WHAT’S AHEAD: If passed into law, the bill would be a first step toward protecting New Yorkers from a pervasive and exploitative business practice that makes them choose between having privacy and using the internet. In partnership with Cornell Tech, we released the NYCx Moonshot Launchpad: a free, downloadable how-to guide that city agencies, community organizations, and industry partners around the world can use to define issues in the public realm that can be addressed through Moonshot challenges. The NYCx Moonshot is a challenge that invites global problem-solvers to partner with the City to develop and test novel solutions that can address pressing urban problems with the goal of improving lives. After two successful NYCx Moonshot Challenges, the Moonshot Launchpad is the first-of-its-kind guide that provides insight into the NYCx methodology for selecting, defining, and drafting Moonshot challenges. The City created the first-ever Library Privacy Week 2018, a week-long celebration of libraries and their unique role in providing patrons with crucial information about protecting their digital privacy. Through the week of October 15th, the Brooklyn Public Library, New York Public Library, Queens Public Library and Metropolitan New York Library Council hosted over 30 data privacy workshops throughout all five boroughs that were free and open to the public. These workshops covered topics ranging from utilizing digital privacy tools to leveraging art to interrogate emerging issues of digital privacy. WHAT’S AHEAD: Due to the success of this inaugural event, we are committed to making this annual program to help all New Yorkers keep pace with digital privacy issues and cybersecurity measures. Our office partnered with the Mozilla Foundation, Research Action Design, the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs and the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City to pilot Stronger NYC Communities, an initiative to provide immigrant-serving organizations with strategies and skills to increase their digital security capacity. The curriculum is now freely available for activists and technologists who work with vulnerable populations across the United States. WHAT’S AHEAD: We are working with the Mayor’s Fund to launch a training program in this upcoming year to include up to 50 additional organizations. NYCx launched its third Moonshot Challenge to tackle the following question: How might we make every small and midsize business in New York City and beyond as resilient to cybersecurity attacks as a Fortune 500 company? In partnership with Cyber Command, NYCEDC and a consortium of international partners, the NYCx Cybersecurity Moonshot Challenge aims to incentivize cyber organizations and startups to develop, test, and build cybersecurity solutions targeted for the small business owners are affordable, effective, and easy-to-use. The City of New York is partnering with Israel’s leading venture capital firm, Jerusalem Venture Partners (JVP), and global partners from Israel, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Berlin, Helsinki, London, and Paris. These partners will work with the City to solicit and evaluate proposals from companies and startups that can secure small and midsize businesses from cyber attacks. Additionally, the Global Cyber Alliance is partnering on the challenge to increase awareness among interested startups and will seek to incorporate Challenge learnings into its ongoing support for small businesses. NYCx Challenge participants can submit concepts online here with the first-round closing in early February 2019. WHAT’S AHEAD: Finalists will be announced in early 2019 and will test their proposals with one winning solution selected with a 6-month pilot to launch before the end of the year. Amsterdam, Barcelona and New York City formally launched the Cities Coalition for Digital Rights, a joint initiative to promote and track progress in protecting residents’ and visitors’ digital rights. The Coalition will create policies, tools and resources to help advance this effort in alignment with the Charter for Human Rights and Principles for the Internet, established within the framework of the UN’s Internet Governance Forum around five core shared principles. The Coalition marks the first time that cities have come together to protect digital rights on a global level. “We serve 8.5 million people with the unique and challenging needs of a diverse population that makes New York City one of the most resilient in the world,” said Deputy Mayor Laura Anglin, City of New York. “Protecting human rights in a digital world is essential to global unity and our ability to serve all people fairly and equally.” Since the launch, other national and international cities are joining the Coalition including Portland, Oregon, and Kansas City, Missouri. WHAT’S AHEAD: 2019 will be a big year for Digital Rights around the world. We’re excited for cities to lead the way. We will work with our partner cities around the world to address each of the core principles with tangible outcomes. -- -- We are using technology to make New York City future ready.

https://medium.com/@joshdotai/how-josh-ai-and-sonys-integrations-work-e8b53b6b9236?source=tag_archive---------89-----------------------,How Josh.ai and Sony’s Integrations Work,Native integrations of Sony products with the Josh platform creates an unmatched luxury media experience.,Josh,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Josh Follow -- Listen Share Josh continues expanding the power of artificial intelligence in the home through a marquee partnership with Sony, an industry leader in premium audio and video technology. Integration with network-enabled Sony XBR TVs, projectors, and receivers provides an array of robust solutions for voice-controlled entertainment spaces. Device compatibility not only results in an unmatched client experience, but a seamless set-up process for the system integrator as well. After connecting to the network Josh auto-populates integrated Sony devices, accelerating the deployment process for custom installers. Configuration of HDMI inputs and AV outputs are visibly diagramed in the Josh portal for intuitive setup. Once the system is completed, the user is able to walk from room to room and simply ask their Josh Micro to turn on their desired content. Alex Capecelatro, CEO of Josh.ai spoke for the entire team when saying: “We’re excited to align with Sony as a fellow innovator in the industry. Our device integrations are incredibly important as we recommend solutions for luxury clients who want performance as well as reliability, with the simplicity of being able to ask for any music or video content in a room and have it instantly play. Sony is a prominent manufacturer for many of our dealers, and we’re excited to continue our development with their product mix. Our goal with Josh.ai is to deliver a magical experience to the user and our relationship with Sony gets us one step closer to that vision.” Once a Sony XBR TV is authorized in the Josh Portal, its location and input assignments are configurable for optimal performance. The current functionality allows for natural speech commands to power the TV on/off, adjust volume, and switch inputs between sources. For the best experience, add a Roku to enable deep-linking to specific content on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or YouTube. Similar to TVs and receivers, projectors may have a “Simple IP” control setting that should be enabled, which allows Josh control when it is turned off. Most projectors will need to be authorized with a code as well, like the pre-shared key for TVs. In the example above, Josh discovered the Sony VPL-VW365ES projector as a video output device. The receiver, which auto-populated as well, has been added to establish the connection between the projector and the Roku assigned to the BD/DVD input. This configuration allows for commands like, “watch Mad Men season 4 episode 5” to turn on the projector, open Netflix, and turn on the desired content. When adding a receiver or amplifying device, it is important to tell Josh where the audio and video outputs are located in the home.The Josh distributed AV framework presents the flexibility to switch receiver inputs between sources, which correlate with the respective AV outputs in that room. In the example above, we have created a Theater Speaker so that Josh knows to route audio to this room from the Sonos Connect assigned to the SA-CD/CD input. This alignment allows for commands like, “listen to Rolling in the Deep by Adele” to execute by switching inputs, and outputs, on the receiver to play the requested content. Josh.ai is a Denver based company with offices in Colorado and California. It creates products and platforms that enable true natural interaction with technology in everyday life. Its flagship product, Josh.ai, uses cutting-edge proprietary technology to deliver a fun and easy-to-use home control experience. Josh Micro, the hardware, offers hands-free voice control in anyroom.

There is a 3-day free fitness pass for KS. I’m fairly tired but I am excited to be able to go to the gym with a friend and learn how to drive more in a more controlled situation. 11:30 am Just had lunch! Roast beef and a toasted bread. Not really the best. Need to shower and sleep but I do want to attend this women’s negotiation event. 1:08 pm Women’s Negotiation & Gender Pay Gap: Riva. “Stephanie is the cofounder and CEO of Riva, an early stage company that uses machine learning to help people negotiate their job offers. She has four degrees from Stanford University including a graduate degree in computer science and an MBA from Stanford’s Graduate School of Business. Previously she worked at Google, McKinsey, and an early stage VC firm and she’s passionate about social impact work. Stephanie will be giving a presentation on Women’s negotiations. We’ll go over the research behind gender pay gap and women’s negotiations. We’ll address some of the key reasons why the gender pay still exists. We’ll cover practical topics such as what women can do to avoid unconscious bias and other forms of bias.” (Obtained from 42) **Women’s Negotiation & Gender Pay Gap: Riva** Stephanie started with ads at Google and had a direct line with a Director at Google. When they finally had a one-one meeting, the Director started doodling on a notepad rather than investing time and listening to her. Another woman, a woman of color, she chose a pay with lower salary because the other company had no other woman of color at the company. These stories are important because 84% of employers expect you to negotiate. Negotiation is part of the job offer processes. If you don’t negotiate, they may think you don’t have any other job offer, etc. What is the difference between a database administrator vs software engineer? The projectory track is different. These jobs are specialized. If you get higher up in your field, it’s harder to transition to another job in the computer science field. Gender Pay Gap$41,554 Women’s Median Earnings while Men’s 2016 Median Earnings are $51,640. 80 cents to the dollar. Recently, it may even be 40 cents per a dollar. What are some possible explanations? (1) Human capital: more women have higher education than men now and more are being educated. Women do tend to have less work experience (eg. taking time off). (2) Industry and Occupation: women tend to take lower paying jobs (eg. nurses vs doctors). These explanations only explain 62% of the wage gap, but the other 38% is due to: (1) Family & career tradeoffs(2) Discrimination & unconscious bias. (3) Women ask less (gender norms, fear of backlash, worse outcomes) Women Ask Less...(1) Gender Norms: women are raised to be nice and caretakers while men are raised to be more assertive. Thought question: If a male holds a female’s bags or books, is it considered gentlemanly or supporting more gender stereotypes? What do you think I would say?(2) Speak less aggressively Women are just as capable of negotiation when:(1) Negotiating on behalf of another(2) Negotiation is signaled to be appropriate: women tend to follow the rules. If a job says no negotiation, the woman will follow the rules and not try to negotiate. The male would do so regardless. Personal comment: We can’t change how other’s think. We could only change how we perceive the world and, hopefully, the rest will follow. Why don’t we focus on changing how we perceive the world? I’m perplexed. Maybe I still don’t quite understand humans? Question: Is this app only for women…? The speaker noted that a woman was undervalued by $300k compared to other tech people of her same level and seniority. Some audience members said the gender gap could have accumulated over time. In addition, the speaker notes she was given data to prove the gap as well. I do like that the speaker does not make any claims without being able to back it up with a reference. 3:19 pm Facebook Fireside chat. 3 women are talking from Facebook about their career path. **Facebook Fireside chat** [Koshambi Shah]Grew up in India. Ended up getting a job with a start-up. Did Cisco but wanted to do something different. Started with Facebook. They have a significant amount of operations.-Biggest success: engagement of her girls. She’s is the role model for her kids. Bringing insight home-“Do not slow down in anticipation” “Make the most out of the opportunity you have today.”- To stay relevant in the tech space, it’s pretty easy at Facebook since thought are welcomed from an organic space.- Has a team with more than 55% of the team is diverse (eg. veterans, ethnicity, gender). When she recruits/hires, she is looking for someone who will compliment her. She is looking for someone who can bring another set of qualities to the table.- “You always want to recruit someone who would feel comfortable working with.”- “It’s time to step outside the comfort zone”- Flexibility of work = important- Looking at compliance for Google wallet.- Opportunities will come your way.- When she was 21 years old, she had a goal/path. By this age, by this time, I will be the CEO of this company. She keeps on having goals but life is a sailing trip. You need to calibrate, be flexible, sometimes alter your plans. Sometimes there are external factors that affect your life. - “How resilient you are on this journey and how persistent you are on this journey will determine how happy you are at your end goal”- Start every team meeting with a 5 minute meditation [Rebecca Nicholas]Accounting major. Got a job in HP(?) out of college. Designed the financial processes at the SRP/ERP systems. Taught herself how to use tech. She learned tech through a financial viewpoint, which proved to be beneficial to her (Glasses). -Biggest learning opportunity: lost $4 million of inventory (laser-jet printer)-”You have to do the basics” to get “to the fun stuff.”- “Take that leap and make a choice. Leap in with both feet and go”- Raised 2 kids in the tech field. The balance is about being presence and being with who you are and the choices you take- “Find ways to make things better.” “How can you improve your job” “Embrace what you have each and every day and look how to make it better”- I want to make sure my daughter has a life full of choices Q: Do you have any advice for nontraditional students getting into the tech field?1) Know your worth and what the job is asking for. Find a way to make your case valid. It’s about how you put your case forward. You can make an excellent story about your path that people would be interested in.2) Silicon Valley is the heart of being open to nontraditional people. There is no better time than now about learning about this pathway. Now is the best time to utilize this opportunity. *Facebook program* People come in for internships. It can be 3-months, 6-months, etc. This is a conversation that 42 Silicon Valley leaders should bring up. Diversity inclusion training/managing biographies is important. Facebook would be glad to partner with 42 regarding VR. One source (A) recommends is glassdoor. If you are looking for someone to gain feedback, they will try to have a good representation in the Developer’s group. There could possibly be a 3-week or 6-week program. Facebook has done with the Girls Who Code program and Ura (?) program. Q: After starting a new job, when did you start looking for the next one?1) When you begin to lose some engagement in your work, stop and reflect. Listen to see what is that drive that you have to continue or going or not going.2) You will know when you want a new job. **Engage your kids with what you do. :) Q: Is there an evaluation system inside Facebook for software engineers once you are on the job?Facebook, unlike any other company, does take its people development extremely passionately and seriously. Performance evaluation is every 6 months. Between every 6 month cycle, you have mid cycle. Feedback is constant. Every 3 months there is some level of formalized feedback. In terms of SWE, there is always mashapps to ensure that the engineers in a certain profile must be callibrated to a certain bar. Quantifying and qualitadable measured. How many code reviews. How well is the code. How many times did the code checker flag the code. Software skills. Mentoring. Influencing peers. Impact pertaining to products. These combined are evaluated in a peer group (360 feedback, boss, team, peers). This is overall evaluation rating. Your manager does not have a say who gets how much bonus/raise. Its formula-based. Reflection on the LectureTo be honest, I’m not a big fan of limiting things based on gender, ethnicity, or nationality. Yes, this can be a temporary solution, but what is the underlying reason? If we just tackle the “symptoms,” then we are not tackling the root cause. Tackling the symptoms can be alright sometimes, and then the society could possibly heal itself, but sometimes it is not alright. I’m not fond of limiting opportunities based on these ideas. Yes, I agree there should be more women in tech. I agree there should be more LBGQT etc. in the office who may provide another perspective. Yes, I agree it’s great to have a diverse workplace where you can find someone with a similar background as you, but we should also expose kiddos, the future generation, to a variety of cultures, genders, and empower all ages, genders, backgrounds etc. If we were to have a test case of students raised in a multicultural immersive environment with every child being empowered in one way or another and developing their skills based on their strengths and interests, then what would happen? This is an ideal world, yes. The world isn’t ideal, but this is how I will raise my child, and how I personally think others should be raised. Once again, all of this is my personal belief and does not reflect the beliefs of anyone else but me. Taking on the devil part, men do not often receive much paternity as well, compared to the female. If the male did, they could take care of the children as well. By not giving the men this opportunity, are we in itself helping create gender discrimination? Are we furthering the roles of stereotypes? This is one thing that I don’t quite understand about how society or most people think. 4:23 pm Bocal had responded to regarding setting up a “Cadet Care,” a mini closet resource center with basic necessities (shampoo, menstrual pads, etc.). They had noted it’s a great idea but they would need to speak to Legal team regarding this since some students may have an unknown allergy to a product in the pantry.

You can find the intro here. Dimension Recap: We spoke earlier about how new layers of value opportunities(represented as Dimension1)were created in the Silicon Industry. We saw that at a macro-level, by abstracting what is scarce and making it abundant, new opportunities of value creation come into place. This post will talk about the value creation in the field of Artificial Intelligence. The Information world has moved from Silicon era(lead by Intel) to internet era(lead by Microsoft, Google) to a mobile era(lead by Facebook, Uber) and now to AI era. This has been fundamentally facilitated by the vast amount of data created and shared across the internet services and applications. www.datadriveninvestor.com Note: The AI industry is relatively new thanks to the improvement in computation facilities supported by Moore’s Law. One thing certain is AI will fundamentally transform every industry. This post is just a collection of where new value opportunities are being created in the field of Artificial Intelligence at a very superficial level. Data Driven World: This has lead to both organized and unorganized data scattered all across. With cloud storage and data storage services in general, the amount of data getting accumulated is on an increase exponentially. Scarce Layer: Application of data — Categorize and process data that are both structured and unstructured. There is enormous value creation opportunity for AI companies that can remove the point of friction: services to process data(structured/unstructured) With the amount of data on an increase and the requirement for faster computation for artificial intelligence applications, especially artificial neural networks, machine vision and machine learning, a scarce layer of AI-specific microprocessors called AI accelerators has been created. A lot of companies have been developing these chips. Perhaps, there is a new entrant in the market or an incumbent who will take the lead by abstracting the scarce element. The new scarce layer that can create enormous value is the enhanced automation process that can act as software robots or AI workers. It’s uncertain whether this can be scaled across industries but there is a potential market space. Once AI becomes a part of day-to-day activities at both enterprise and individual level, the scarce layer could reduce the bandwidth between humans and machines and potentially, a way to integrate the two. Companies such as Kernel and Neuralink are leading the R&D.

https://medium.com/the-relevance-house/dealing-with-the-short-attention-span-on-social-media-49e5e0b39c62?source=tag_archive---------33-----------------------,Dealing with the Short Attention Span on Social Media,Published in THE RELEVANCE HOUSE,The Relevance House,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in The Relevance House Follow THE RELEVANCE HOUSE -- Listen Share Social media is often blamed for people’s short attention span. However, it can also be turned the other way around: people’s short attention span is modifying the way we communicate on social media. In fact, in our shaped-by-smartphone world, consumers value immediacy, relevance, and convenience. So how can social media marketing adapt to this kind of audience? There are tactics to adopt in both content and format to achieve good performance for your company’s social accounts, or those of your clients. In this article, we’re going to have a look at some techniques that adapt to today’s audiences. 1. Keep it simple and clearOn social media, everything moves fast. For this reason, a post shouldn’t require too much thinking to trigger liking, sharing or commenting. Don’t confuse “keep it simple” with the type of tone you use. Those are two separate things. In fact, if you’re managing the account of a bank, you often can’t have a light-hearted and casual tone — but can still use simple syntax. The Twitter account of the National Bank of England is doing a great job at this: Overall, their phrasing is simple and clean, but at the same time, they use a tone that is still suitable for a bank. 2. Keep it short and sweetSomething also to point out is the length of the text. Shorter posts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have higher engagement than longer ones. People look for easy content to read and something that engages without too much effort, therefore, these platforms have features that allow an immediate way of communicating. Twitter offers a “thread” function, which means you tell stories or messages through a chain of tweets. You can immediately guess why threads perform better than a pre-scheduled tweet. It’s about immediacy and relevance. It catches attention because people want to see what comes next in the story, and they’re easy to consume, just like videos. Here’s an example of how a thread works. Instagram offers “stories”, an immediate and ephemeral way to communicate with followers. This platform is mainly centered on the visual impact, thus it is suggested to spend time on an entertaining video/picture rather than writing a great caption underneath. Therefore, even if the character limit is 2,200, social media experts suggest to keep it around 125 characters. This is due to the fact that captions longer than that aren’t shown completely, and one would have to tap on “read more”, which is highly unlikely these days. Facebook behaves in a similar way. Experts at BuzzSumo point out that “Facebook consumption is extremely passive, and attention spans are short. You need to be able to grab people’s attention quickly and effectively if you want to be noticed.” They suggest to use catchy pictures and keep the caption under 100 characters. Let’s not forget though that longer posts are good for SEO, and that you should always test what works for your own audience. If there is already a certain level of loyalty, as people know that your long posts are high-quality and they know that there’s an intrinsic benefit from reading them, then the length shouldn’t be reduced. When you form a trust relationship with the audience, it’s easier to get high engagement with long posts too. For LinkedIn, the dynamic is different mainly because it’s a social platform designed for professionals who want to share knowledge and news. Writing long posts is actually recommended in the best practices for Linkedin: “People like to read long-form content on LinkedIn — 1,900 to 2,000 words long” says Noah Kagan, social media expert. However, there’s a certain type of content that is favored: how-to posts and list-style posts. The reason why these two formats perform well, it’s because they’re easy to consume and understand. “How-to” titles trigger the attention because people immediately associate the post with an intrinsic benefit from reading it. They could learn something new from it so extract further benefits. The “list-style” posts are designed in a way that is appealing to the human brain: short points that are easy to mentally process and integrate in one’s pre-existing knowledge about the topic. 3. Use video contentVideos have demonstrated to be highly engaging on social media, because of the ease of information consumption that they allow and the emotions they trigger. Emotions are the way to connect with people on social media, what else could be more powerful than them? Therefore, videos have to tell a story, trigger oxytocin in the brain, the neurochemical responsible for empathy. Think about John Lewis’ Christmas commercials: these videos are real tear-jerkers! The high engagement on this tweet says it all. Emotions and immediate access to them are key to the success of social media. Think about Instagram stories: the most used function of the platform, growing 15x over feeds. Their success has not only to do with the format (short video) but also with their perceived genuineness. “Stories feel real, immediate, and intensely personal” claim Hootsuite experts. Many big companies are adopting stories to make people feel closer to their brand because it’s a highly flexible functionality and can serve different types of business (from serious corporations to hand-made jewelry shops). So, it’s a fact: video content helps to catch the attention and often leads to higher engagement on social media, however, there are contraindications too. For instance, videos that automatically start playing on the home page can annoy people, rather than engage them. In this case, one needs to tailor the video usage according to the type of audience and social platform. These were some of the suggestions to deal with today’s social media audiences. The attention-span is probably going to worsen in the near future, so social media platforms are metaphorically racing against the clock, and we’ll see what new tricks come out.

In cells, they used the technology to convert the gene variant APOE4 — a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease — into the non-pathogenic variant APOE2. The research is published in the journal Science. Meanwhile, the team has garnered headlines lately for starting up Beam Therapeutics and raising $222 million to fund its research. Beam Therapeutics is co-founded by Zhang Feng, J. Keith Joung and David Liu, which three of them are all an outstanding pioneer in the area of CRISPR research. Besides, Beam has also received the supportive funding from Arch Venture Partners and GV(Google Venture)during its series A and series B funding.

VRBs are quite something. Unlike traditional lead-acid batteries of the time, or the lithium-ion wonders of today, they store and convert energy separately. They stockpile electricity as chemical energy in two large tanks filled with electrolytic fluids, which are connected to electrochemical cells. This allows the amount of electricity stored, and the power discharged, to be handled independently. They can be left unused for long periods with no loss of power; and the electrolyte never catches fire, unlike the more temperamental lithium-ion batteries in smartphones today. -- -- 7 where the future is written science journalist | www.wilsondasilva.com | Support my writing by joining Medium via wilsondasilva.medium.com/membership Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*9fGJUGK-16MbexGgfHNB-w.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*EetZyjDw-19wRRBzc6fSMA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*EetZyjDw-19wRRBzc6fSMA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*EetZyjDw-19wRRBzc6fSMA.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*9fGJUGK-16MbexGgfHNB-w.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*9fGJUGK-16MbexGgfHNB-w.jpeg"

Akan tetapi, istilah ini masih belum banyak dimengerti sehingga publik mengira bahwa ray tracing adalah fitur Nvidia terbaru. Ray tracing sesungguhnya adalah sebuah teknik pembangunan gambar dari model (rendering) yang mampu menampilkan efek cahaya yang sangat realistis dan sudah banyak digunakan di industri film. Pada tulisan ini, kita akan menelusuri lebih jauh mengenai ray tracing, termasuk aplikasinya dalam bidang komputer grafis. Sejak tahun 1990, pemodelan 3D konvensional menggunakan proses yang bernama rasterization. Proses ini menggunakan kumpulan segitiga dan poligon untuk membuat model objek tiga dimensi. Kemudian, model tersebut dikonversi lagi menjadi pixels dan dilanjutkan dengan berbagai post-processing sebelum menjadi gambar akhir yang akan ditampilkan ke layar. Mengutip dari web resmi Nvidia, ray tracing mampu mensimulasikan perilaku fisik cahaya. Ray tracing mampu mengkalkulasikan warna dari pixels dengan menelusuri jalur yang ditempuh cahaya seolah-olah tampilan layar yang ditonton berasal dari mata penonton sendiri. Berbagai perilaku dari cahaya seperti refleksi, refraksi, dan bayangan menentukan warna akhir dari setiap pixel di layar. Hal terpenting yang kita butuhkan untuk menciptakan sebuah gambar adalah sebuah permukaan dua dimensi. Kemudian, kita dapat meng-visualisasikan permukaan tersebut sebagai dasar sebuah piramida horizontal dengan puncak (vantage point) piramida tersebut terletak di tengah mata kita dan tingginya sejajar dengan arah pandang (line of sight) kita. Dasar piramida tersebut kemudian kita sebut sebagai image plane atau canvas. Ilustrasi berdasarkan visualisasi tersebut antara lain sebagai berikut. Image plane ini berfungsi sebagai permukaan dua dimensi yang akan kita gunakan untuk memproyeksikan berbagai tampilan tiga dimensi. Sebagai contoh, jika kita ingin menggambar sebuah kubus tiga dimensi pada sebuah image plane maka kita perlu menggambarkan garis-garis yang saling menghubungkan titik-titik sudut kubus yang terlihat oleh mata. Pada gambar berikut, titik-titik sudut tersebut diberi nama c0, c1, c2, dan c3. Setelah itu, kita menarik garis dari masing-masing sudut tersebut ke vantage point yang merupakan mata kita. Perpotongan garis-garis tersebut dengan image plane juga membentuk titik-titik sudut yang akan merepresentasikan kubus tiga dimensi tersebut pada image plane. Titik-titik sudut tersebut kemudian disebut c0’, c1’, c2, dan c3’. Persegi hasil proyeksi tersebut yang akan ditampilkan pada layar dua dimensi. Metode diatas dinamakan sebagai perspective projection yang berfungsi untuk menerjemahkan objek-objek tiga dimensi yang kita lihat sehari-hari menjadi dua dimensi. Setelah kita mampu menggambar outline dari objek tiga dimensi pada sebuah permukaan dua dimensi, kita mampu menambahkan warna pada gambar tersebut. Seperti yang kita ketahui, kecerahan dan warna adalah hasil dari interaksi cahaya dengan material objek. Cahaya terbentuk dari photon mampu diserap, direfleksikan, atau ditransmisikan oleh objek-objek yang berinteraksi dengan photon tersebut. Besar persentase photon yang diserap, direfleksikan, dan ditransmisikan oleh berbagai material objek menentukan bagaimana objek tersebut terlihat oleh mata. Sebagai contoh, cahaya putih terbentuk dari photon RGB (Red, Green, Blue). Jika sebuah objek berwarna merah maka material objek tersebut menyerap photon Green dan photon Blue tetapi merefleksikan photon Red yang akan ditangkap oleh mata dan menerjemahkannya menjadi warna merah. Perlu diingat bahwa contoh diatas hanyalah simplifikasi, photon tidak sesungguhnya bersifat RGB. Selain itu, tingkat kecerahan dari suatu objek yang berasal dari jumlah photon yang dipantulkan juga memberikan dimensi lain bagi mata untuk merepresentasikan objek tersebut, seperti shading. Melihat pentingnya cahaya bagi penampilan objek, ray tracing dapat dikatakan juga mempunyai peran penting dalam menentukan penampilan gambar ke layar monitor kita. Ray tracing dinamakan demikian karena metode tersebut mensimulasikan jalur dari sinar cahaya (light rays) berasal dari sumber cahaya menuju mata manusia. Tujuan yang ingin diraih dari ray tracing yakni menentukan warna dari light rays tersebut, terutama jika light rays mengalami banyak pantulan dari berbagai objek. Penjelasan diatas akan jauh lebih mudah dipahami melalui gambar berikut. Seperti yang telah kita pelajari di sub-bab sebelumnya, kita melihat objek tiga dimensi dalam dua dimensi melalui image plane, dan warna objek diperoleh dari warna yang direfleksikan oleh material objek tersebut. Pada gambar diatas, terdapat suatu sumber cahaya, misal sebuah bohlam lampu, yang memancarkan cahaya ke segala arah. Jika kita melakukan tracing pada cahaya tersebut dari bohlam lampu maka kita akan dihadapi dengan beberapa pertanyaan: Pada ilustrasi diatas, garis panah utuh adalah sinar yang mempunyai jalur menuju ke mata, baik langsung maupun melalui pantulan, sedangkan garis panah terputus-putus adalah sinar-sinar yang tidak menuju ke mata. Tugas kita yakni mampu memilih sinar yang mempunyai jalur seperti garis panah utuh karena melakukan tracing pada sinar yang tidak menuju mata hanya akan menguras resources. Pertanyaan-pertanyaan di paragraf sebelumnya membuat tracing sinar-sinar yang terjamin menuju ke mata sangatlah sulit. Akan tetapi, jika kita melihat permasalahan tersebut secara terbalik (backwards), solusi dari permasalahan tersebut sangatlah mudah. Solusi tersebut yakni kita melakukan tracing sinar-sinar tersebut bukan dari bohlam, tetapi dari mata. Sebagai contoh, kita memilih sebuah titik pada image plane yang ingin kita ketahui warnanya. Warna dari titik tersebut berasal dari light ray yang menembus titik itu. Kita mampu melakukan tracing mulai dari mata, lalu menembus titik tersebut, dan seterusnya hingga mencapai sumber cahaya sehingga kita dapat mengetahui warna dari titik tersebut berdasarkan material objek-objek yang menumbuk tracing kita. Metode ini disebut sebagai backward tracing yang dapat diilustrasikan sebagai berikut. Algoritma Ray Tracing mengambil sebuah gambar yang terbuat dari pixels. Untuk setiap pixel-nya, kita menembakkan sebuah sinar utama (primary ray) menuju image plane yang berasal dari mata. Kemudian, kita melakukan tracing pada sinar utama tersebut untuk menentukan arahnya dan objek-objek yang tertumbuk oleh sinar tersebut. Pada kasus tertentu dimana sinar utama menumbuk lebih dari satu objek, kita memilih objek tertumbuk yang paling dekat ke mata dan menembakkan sebuah sinar bayangan (shadow ray) dari titik tumbukkan pada objek tersebut menuju sumber cahaya seperti gambar dibawah ini. Jika sinar bayangan tidak menumbuk objek lain saat menuju sumber cahaya maka titik tumbukkan tersebut terkena sinar langsung. Sedangkan, jika sinar bayangan menumbuk benda lain, maka titik tumbukkan tersebut dibayangin oleh objek yang ditumbuk oleh sinar bayangan. Jika kita mengulangi proses ini untuk setiap pixel, kita akan mendapatkan sebuah representasi dua dimensi dari sebuah pemandangan tiga dimensi. Berikut adalah implementasi algoritma ray tracing dalam bentuk pseudocode. Sesungguhnya materi-materi yang telah dibahas diatas hanyalah tip of the iceberg dari ray tracing yang sesungguhnya. Kita mampu mengkalkulasikan refleksi, refraksi, dan sifat-sifat cahaya lain untuk menghasilkan gambar yang semakin indah dan akurat dengan fenomena cahaya yang sesungguhnya. Oleh karena itu, penulis menganjurkan untuk membuka referensi-referensi yang digunakan oleh penulis untuk memperdalam wawasan pembaca mengenai ray tracing. Hayward, Andrew. (2018, March 21).

Et en effet, depuis 2012, cette technologie continue de repousser les limites de ce que peuvent faire les ordinateurs, au point de dépasser certaines performances humaines. Mais attention aux effets de buzz : le Deep Learning excelle seulement dans certains domaines. Les principaux étant : Cet article s’intéresse à une autre catégorie : celle du traitement du langage (Natural language processing). Depuis 2013, les méthodes utilisées étaient assez similaires pour la plupart des tâches, avec des performances qui évoluaient doucement. En 2018, un pas de géant a été réalisé, et les performances de traitement du langage ont explosées. Mais quel est ce nouveau modèle et quels sont les cas d’usage ? Traiter le langage naturel a de nombreuses applications, par exemple : L’approche des vecteurs de mots (word2vec) consiste à associer chaque mot à un vecteur (un ensemble de nombres), chaque vecteur portant une représentation sémantique du mot. Associer un vecteur à chaque mot permet de les projeter dans un espace vectoriel. Et deux mots ayant un sens proche seront représentés par des points proches dans cet espace. Cette approche est puissante et permet d’effectuer des transformations intéressantes. Par exemple, comme illustré ci-dessous, en calculant la distance entre les mots Homme et Femme et en appliquant cette distance au mot Roi, on obtient en résultat le mot Reine. Ces vecteurs sont pré-calculés à partir de gros corpus de texte et sont ensuite utilisés comme première couche pour construire des modèles et applications par dessus. Le nouveau modèle n’aura donc pas à apprendre à partir de zéro le sens des mots. En 2018, une nouvelle approche est apparue. D’abord timidement, puis au regard de résultats impressionnants (bien supérieurs aux autres approches), de nombreux articles scientifiques et modèles ont été publiés. Et les GAFA ont pu largement augmenter la performance de leurs algorithmes liés aux langages. La nouvelle approche est similaire à celle utilisée dans le domaine de la vision par ordinateur depuis des années : entraîner un modèle complet à réaliser une tâche avec beaucoup de données. Puis, se servir de ce modèle pré-entraîné pour réaliser d’autres tâches, en bénéficiant de l’apprentissage précédent. C’est ce que l’on appelle le transfert d’apprentissage. Dans le monde de la vision, il est désormais rare d’entraîner un nouveau modèle à partir de zéro (hors recherche). L’approche classique est plutôt d’utiliser un modèle pré-entraîné sur le jeu de données ImageNet contenant plus de 14 millions d’images annotées en plus de 20000 catégories. Et ensuite de rajouter des couches à ce modèle pour appliquer une autre fonction (ex: repérer les positions des objets, classifier les images, etc.). Mais n’est-ce pas similaire à l’approche des vecteurs de mots ? Il faut comprendre qu’un réseau de neurone est composé de différentes couches. Les premières couches représentent des structures “simples” (ex : angles, lignes) et les couches suivantes se basent sur ces structures simples pour représenter des structures plus complexes. Pour schématiser : en traitement du langage, la première couche peut représenter les mots. Les couches intermédiaires peuvent représenter les phrases et paragraphes. Et les dernières couches concerner le sens global du texte. Avec les vecteurs de mots, seule la première couche (contenant le sens des mots) est pré-entraînée. Les autres couches doivent apprendre de zéro, ce qui nécessite beaucoup de données et de calculs. La nouvelle approche est de pré-entraîner toutes les couches d’un modèle profond à réaliser une tâche simple, comme prédire le prochain mot. Ainsi, on dispose de données à volonté (par exemple, de tout Wikipédia) et le modèle peut développer une représentation complexe du langage. Une fois ce modèle pré-entraîné, il est possible de le réutiliser pour d’autres tâches en rajoutant des couches par dessus, par exemple pour classifier les textes en différentes catégories. Le modèle bénéficiera de sa compréhension du langage et n’aura à apprendre que la partie classification, ce qui est plus efficace et demande moins de données. Tout au long de l’année dernière (2018), plusieurs modèles fonctionnant ainsi ont été créés, les principaux étant : Pour le Français, à l’heure actuelle il est possible de télécharger les modèles pré-entraînés suivants : Et au regard du rythme d’évolution dans ce domaine, l’année 2019 promet encore de belles avancées ! -- -- Le blog de la School of AI en France.

Jonathan is the co-founder of Sole Bicycles, the leading direct-to-consumer lifestyle bicycle brand. He also founded Humin, acquired by Tinder, an AI messaging and contacts app named one of the “100 Best Inventions of the Year” by Pop-Sci & listed as “100 Greatest Apps of all Time” by Business Insider. Jonathan is also currently building Snaps, the AI messaging platform for Nike Jordan, Live Nation, Marriott Hotels & more. Thank you so much for joining us! Can you tell us a story about what brought you to this specific career path? I have always been an entrepreneur, even since I was a little kid. In 2009, fixed gear bicycles started gaining popularity from bicycles messengers and city dwellers. If you wanted to ride a fixed gear bicycle, you had to buy an old road bicycle frame, rims, grips, and build a bike from scratch. I started looking into that process and realized to build the bicycle I wanted, it would cost $1500, money I didn’t have as a college student. So I got resourceful and had the idea to go right to the source. I googled “bicycle manufacturer” and discovered a website where I could connect with bicycle factories, globally. After researching the perfect bicycle frame, tires and parts specifications, I knew exactly what to ask the factories to manufacture. Ultimately, I found a partner who was willing to make me a “sample”. The original bicycle sample cost just $57 to make. After receiving this sample, many friends started asking about this bike and if they could get one as well, so did the local bicycle shops by our university. That was the catalyst for the business. Solé Bicycles was officially founded in 2009 because we were fed up with the state of fixed and single speed bicycles. With a shared determination and a vision of change, we set out to introduce high performance and stylish bicycles that wouldn’t break the bank. Can you share your story of Grit and Success? First can you tell us a story about the hard times that you faced when you first started your journey? One of my investors and advisors Peter Diamandis said, “Patience is a virtue, but persistence to the point of success is a blessing”. Having persistence, grit and pushing through the hard times is absolutely vital to any entrepreneur’s success. At one point in the company, we had outgrown our initial manufacturing partner and partnered with one of the leading manufacturers in the world. This new, and much larger partner unfortunately sent us faulty products and as a small company, we absorbed all those costs to keep our riders happy. It could have bankrupted the company, but instead we reached out to every customer and proactively shipped new components. Our riders were so appreciative and understanding to our outreach that many of them ended up referring our products to their friends and family. Where did you get the drive to continue even though things were so hard? I love the expression “It takes 10 years to become an overnight success”. Since inception, Sole has generated over $10M in sales, sold over 40,000 bicycles, all with only $300k of capital raised. Every day is a new struggle but we continue to invest and improve our products. After someone purchases a bicycle on our site we have an attribution pop-up; over 60% of sales are attributable to word-of-mouth which lets us know we’re doing something right. What do you think makes your company stand out? Can you share a story? We founded Sole Bicycles because we were fed up with the state of fixed and single speed bicycles…. And the bicycle buying process in general. With a shared determination and a vision of change, we set out to introduce high performance and stylish bicycles that wouldn’t break the bank. Our passions for design, simplicity, and craftsmanship shine brighter than ever, translating into our best bikes yet. We’re constantly intrigued and influenced by the vast and intricate surroundings at our home in Venice Beach, California. The culture of this iconic city courses through our veins thus creating a unique umbrella of music, art, and apparel all delicately catered to your Solé experience. A Solé bicycle should be an extension of yourself, and we believe that we have cultivated a bond unlike any other company. Gen-Z and Millennials are integrating bicycling into their daily lives and city planners are acting accordingly. Today people want simplicity, and are driven by personal values and lifestyle choices. The bike has become a natural extension of people’s lives as a functional utility, personal statement of social responsibility and smarter living. We define our product by the “lifestyle radius” which is defined as 5–6 miles from one’s home. One story or unique element about Sole that makes us stand out is through partnerships/collaborations. We like to work with other like minded companies and love to produce great looking collaborative products. We’ve teamed up with brands like Casamigos, Surf Lodge, Sephora, Rag & Bone and more to drive new revenue and awareness. We’ve also launched the Solé Fixtapes series, a curated monthly mixtape series crafted by our favorite musicians fueled by the tunes that both inspire and move them. Keeping consistent with our feel-good, always on the move lifestyle, our handpicked artists are true pioneers in originality and sound. We let them loose on the decks, with ‘movement’ on their minds. We have close to 4.5M plays and have worked with artists like RAC, Classixx, Viceroy, Breakbot and more. • Hundreds of thousands of impressions & interactions world-wide. Each tape generates hundreds of new ‘Likes’ on our Facebook Page and these tapes are blogged all over the internet spiderwebbing viral reach to new fans. We also tap into local communities. Solé prides itself with becoming involved and active within the community and one way we accomplish this is with our communal bicycle rides. Whether its teaming up with a local business, brand, or friends and family, Solé rides aim to please and are not to be missed. Some past memorable rides include the Zanerobe team, House Beer, Cyclones LA, and the offices of Scooter Braun. Which tips would you recommend to your colleagues in your industry to help them to thrive and not “burn out”? If you’re not having fun it doesn’t count. How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world? One area that I am passionate about using my success is promoting entrepreneurship. I helped found The Kairos Society in 2008 to enable young entrepreneurs bring high-impact innovations to market. The fellowship bow spans over 50 countries, and includes over 1,200 fellows and alumni from the most prestigious universities in the world. The Kairos Society is committed to advancing the world in areas such as education, healthcare, and clean energy. We believe that these global challenges are entrepreneurs’ greatest opportunities.

Given the scale of e-commerce, it is no surprise that the Amazon Marketing Service, or Advertising Service, is one of the largest advertising platforms out there. It rivals Google AdWords in its scope and business impact for e-commerce for driving traffic to an Amazon product page. If you are not familiar with AMZ Advertising, the service provides advertising solutions for Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands, Stores, display ads, and video ads. It also connects to advertisements within the Amazon DSP. This covers a gamut of Ad related activities like relevant keywords, search ads, product display ads, sponsored product ads, and many others. Any time you perform an Amazon search, you leverage their internal Search engine. Like Google search, Amazon search will deliver both organic results. In addition to organic results, Amazon pay per click (PPC) will target paid ads in search results as well as product pages. Two of the more commonly used solutions are Amazon Sponsored Products and Amazon Sponsored Brands. Both of these are self-serve and cost-per-click (CPC) based. They are available to registered sellers, vendors, book vendors, Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) authors, app developers, and agencies. Two of the more recognized aspects are keywords and sponsored brands; Optimizing paid ads improves the Amazon sales you can realize from your media investments. This is a critical foundation for a successful Amazon marketing strategy. The pro sellers recognize data is the secret to unlocking e-commerce sales growth. Having data allows them to optimize ad spend, inform inventory management decisions, and target special offers, promotions, and other tactics for specific products. The pros are tapping into AMZ Advertising performance data to maximize sales performance and accelerate growth. Unfortunately, most sellers defaulting to using the primary reporting interface is not going to help them accelerate their selling efforts. For example, they manually download a report from the AMZ advertising console, which can be slow and out of date minutes after you have clicked “open” in Excel. If you answered yes, then you are on the right path to optimizing sales and profits. So how do you tap into all this rich Advertising data? The Amazon Advertising API is key to unlocking performance insights. The API provides a broad collection of performance data that supports detailed reporting and measurement efforts. For data-driven advertisers, the API will supply data that helps you measure the impact of advertising investments.

The final report will be issued over the next year. [EDITOR’S NOTE: The MIT IDE will explore this and other timely themes on the future of work with co-hosts WOTF Task Force and CSAIL at the upcoming MIT AI & the Work of the Future Congress on Nov. 21. An Unconference Workshop follows on Nov. 22 where participants can actively engage in crafting a future where innovation, inclusion, and economic opportunity is a possibility for all. Register at http://bit.ly/MITWOTF.] The Task Force was convened in the spring of 2018 by MIT President Rafael Reif to address what may well be the most critical question of the digital economy: As emerging technologies raise aggregate economic output and the wealth of nations, will they also enable people to attain higher living standards, better working conditions, greater economic security, and improved health and longevity? The report’s overriding conclusion is that the likelihood that AI and automation will wipe out major workforce sectors in the near future is exaggerated. However, we’ve already seen important reasons for concern, especially the rising polarization of employment and wage distribution over the past few decades, which has disproportionately benefited high-skilled professionals while reducing opportunities for mid- and low-skilled workers. “[A] critical challenge is not necessarily a lack of jobs, but the low quality of many jobs and the resulting lack of viable careers for many people, particularly workers without college degrees. With this in mind, the work of the future can be shaped beneficially by new policies, renewed support for labor, and reformed institutions, not just new technologies. Broadly, the task force concludes, capitalism in the U.S. must address the interests of workers as well as shareholders.” Let me briefly discuss some of the report’s key findings and recommendations. The Paradox of the Present. “Most advanced economies are enjoying an unprecedented, broad based jobs boom,” wrote The Economist in a May, 2019 article. Two-thirds of the 36 OECD member countries have record-high employment. The U.S. unemployment rate remains at a near-historic low of 3.7%, while wages have also been increasing across the economy. Yet, as The Economist notes, many throughout the industrialized world feel underpaid, exploited, and pessimistic about a future where intelligent machines threaten to make them unemployable. Other surveys have similarly found a widespread belief that advanced technologies will replace much of the work now done by humans. “There is just one problem with this bleak picture: It is at odds with reality,” says The Economist. “The zeitgeist has lost touch with the data.” According to the MIT Task Force, while these fears are greatly exaggerated, they’re neither ill-informed nor misguided. Recent history has shown that there’s ample reason to be concerned about the impact of technological advances on large segments of the workforce. Whether the impact will turn out to be positive or negative depends on many factors, especially societal investments in education and public/private leadership. For example, demographic trends point toward rising labor scarcity in the U.S. and most other industrialized countries due to declining fertility, an aging population, and restrictive immigration policies. The growth rate of the U.S. labor force fell from 1.2% per year between 1996 and 2006 to 0.5% per year between 2006 and 2016, and is projected to continue at this low rate over the next decade. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the share of workers 55 and over will rise from 16.8% to 24.8% between 2006 and 2026, while the share of prime age workers (25–54) will fall by 5%. “These demographic shifts will impose steep burdens on national budgets as the ratio of retirees to workers rises and as the growth rate of working-age taxpayers slows. But these shifts also offer an opportunity: countries that make well-targeted, forward-looking investments in education and skills training should be able to deliver middle-skill jobs with favorable earnings and employment security to the vast majority of their workers — and not exclusively to those with elite educations.” Is This Time Different? Fears that machines will put humans out of work are not new. Throughout the Industrial Revolution there were periodic panics about the impact of automation on jobs, going back to the so-called Luddites — textile workers who in the 1810s smashed the new machines that were threatening their jobs. Automation anxieties continued to resurface in the 20th century, right along with advances in technology. In a 1930 essay, English economist John Maynard Keynes wrote about the onset of “a new disease” which he named technological unemployment, that is, “unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.” But, in the end, these fears didn’t come to pass. Given that technologies have been automating human work for the past couple of centuries — why hasn’t automation already wiped out a majority of jobs? Why are there still so many jobs left? The answer isn’t very complicated, although frequently overlooked, explained MIT economist and Task Force co-chair David Autor in a 2015 paper. Automation does indeed substitute for labor. However, automation also complements labor, raising economic outputs in ways that often lead to higher demand for workers. “[J]ournalists and even expert commentators tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor.” Automation fears have understandably accelerated in recent years, as our increasingly smart machines are now being applied to activities requiring intelligence and cognitive capabilities that not long ago were viewed as the exclusive domain of humans. While the majority of economists wave such fears away, we don’t really know whether this time might be different. How are job markets likely to evolve in our 21st century digital economy? The digital era differs from prior waves of automation in a few important respects, said the MIT Task Force: labor market polarization has spurred growth of high-skill, high-wage and low-skill, low-wage jobs at the expense of mid-skill, mid-wage jobs; rising inequality has concentrated earning growth among the most educated, highest-skilled workers while the earnings growth for most everyone else has lagged; and low productivity technologies have displaced many categories of work previously done by less educated workers. “Americans are right to be worried… If the advent of ubiquitous robotics and artificial intelligence heralds another era like the recent past, popular concerns will be amply justified. The obvious next question, and the question that animates the work of the Task Force, is, what can be done about it? Despite the sobering record of the last 40 years, our research argues against fatalism and in favor of tempered optimism. Better work and broadly shared prosperity are not assured, but both are feasible, and technological advances make them more, and not less attainable.” Policy Proposals for the Future Foremost among the recommendations is the urgent need to provide workers with the skills required to meet these technology and workforce challenges, especially workers without a four-year college degree who have disproportionately borne the brunt of automation. Post-secondary education and training venues— e.g., community colleges, apprenticeships, online education, industry-specific training programs— are likely to be most relevant and accessible to these workers. However, the report adds that education and training won’t be enough given the demands for career-long adult learning. A better understanding of what kind of learning is most effective for adults is required. “Although new technology can support novel learning experiences, from personalized instruction to virtual reality displays, it is unclear what practices actually facilitate learning for adults… It is highly likely that technology can promote adult learning, but it is not yet known what principles guide the implementation of effective adult learning.” Finally, the report cautions that “hoping that if we skill them, jobs will come, is an inadequate foundation for constructing a more productive and economically secure labor market.” Thus, alongside education and training, the Task Force recommends four broad areas where concerted public and private action are essential to shaping the future of work: “By taking bold actions to invest in its people, lead in innovation, and protect and augment workers, the United States can cultivate this historic opportunity to generate broadly shared prosperity.” This blog was first posted here. -- -- The IDE explores how people and businesses work, interact, and prosper in an era of profound digital transformation.

https://medium.com/@RidgewayInfo/disrupting-the-edge-of-the-internet-blackouts-in-sudan-and-ethiopia-46b476238f8d?source=tag_archive---------61-----------------------,Disrupting the Edge of the Internet: Blackouts in Sudan and Ethiopia,Written by Ridgeway Information,Ridgeway Information,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ridgeway Information Follow -- Listen Share This post was written by Asher Kessler a Research Intern at Ridgeway Information, a King’s College London spinout company specialising in open source intelligence research, training, and consultancy. Over the course of June 2019, both the Ethiopian and Sudanese people have experienced widespread internet blackouts. However, the neighbouring countries experienced two very different types of internet blackouts for quite different purposes. In Sudan, the military regime was able to restrict private internet access by disrupting carrier-grade networks. By only attacking the ‘edge’ of the internet, the regime ensured that security services could remain online while protesters had no access. Meanwhile in Ethiopia, the state is reported to have caused two almost total internet blackouts in June in response to an attempted coup and as a measure to stop school exam cheating. Sudan: Attacking the Edge of the Internet Sudan has a long history of internet interference and during the popular protest movement against dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019, the Sudanese regime often restricted online access. In April 2019, Omar al-Bashir’s regime collapsed in the face of a widespread popular uprising. Since then there has been a major confrontation between protestors and the military, who have seized control of the country. On 3 June a partial internet blackout spread across Sudan with mobile access being particularly affected. While specific providers, such as MTN and Mobitel (Zain) were restricted, internet users could still access fixed-line networks run by Sudatel and Canar. The partial blackout was in response to the failed negotiations between the military and the protestors, however it also occurred on the same day that the military raided a Khartoum sit-in, reportedly with shots fired. Two days later on 5 June, the internet blackout was extended to affect Sudan’s fixed-line connectivity as well as mobile accessed internet. Once again the blackout accompanied violence. A paramilitary group killed over 100 sit-in demonstrators in Khartoum. By 10 June, the last remaining internet provider Sudatel was disrupted with the army accepting responsibility for the blackout. Attacking the edge of the internet The Sudanese military caused a very specific type of internet blackout. For a start, research from Net Blocks show that nationwide IP connectivity only fell to 80%. Yet, the 20% targeted by the military held within it the gateways for carrier-grade network (CGNAT) routes that connect the majority of Sudan’s citizens. CGNATs allow internet providers to bunch together private internet users under a single public IP address. What this means in this context is that by disrupting CGNAT routes, the military was able to efficiently restrict internet access to private customers without disrupting the core Sudanese internet infrastructure. By maintaining the core internet infrastructure, the Sudanese military is likely to have kept continued internet access for security workers and state officials. Thus, by attacking the edge networks and disrupting CGNAT routes, the Sudanese military not only disrupted the organisation of protests and the flow of information out of the country, but they give security forces an advantage by keeping them online. Ethiopia: A Failed Coup & Exam Cheating Violence erupted in Amhara state, in northern Ethiopia on 22 June. The Amhara State President and the Army’s chief of staff were assassinated in two separate attacks. Reports suggest that this was an attempted coup led by General Asamnew Tsige who was recently released from prison after serving time for a similar coup attempt. On the same day as the coup the internet was largely disconnected in Ethiopia. In contrast to Sudan, network data in Ethiopia dropped to 2% of its normal use. The blackout began in northern Ethiopia and spread to the eastern regions before eventually disconnecting the whole of the country. Because Ethiopia only has one internet provider, which is state run, it is far easier for the government to completely disconnect the country. According to NetBlocks, the remaining 2% connectivity may belong to officials in the capital as well as tourist locations. Although no party has claimed responsibility for the internet blackout although it is likely to have been a Government response to the coup. This was not the first time the state disrupted internet access in Ethiopia. Earlier in June, after the state partially restricted messaging apps, Ethiopia’s internet was totally cut off. Bizarrely the internet blackout was believed to be an attempt to counter cheating during the national secondary school final exams. While internet blackouts are often thought of as simply switching off the plug, these two case studies show they can manifest in quite different ways. The internet infrastructure of a country, alongside the purposes of the blackout, influence just how internet disruption will occur. -- -- King's College London spinout company specialising in open source intelligence research, training, and consultancy. www.ridgeway-information.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*U8am9-EqxFwPVPLHamMx4w.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*U8am9-EqxFwPVPLHamMx4w.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*U8am9-EqxFwPVPLHamMx4w.jpeg"

We are very excited to be there as attendees of course, but also as part of a startup pitch competition. What is AgriVest? According to AgriVest, We live in a world of change. From dwindling amounts of usable land, to a scarcity of natural resources, to shifting climate patterns, the challenge facing growers and multinationals alike is the same: to grow more with less — more crops and more food with less land, less water, and less energy. AgriVest addresses this challenge by bringing together leaders from industry, business, and government in a forum focused on the trends, the inventive solutions from 12 young Israeli agrifood tech companies, and the opportunities that await both the innovators and investors in this sector. Who else is attending AgriVest? And here is some info on the other amazing companies taking part in the pitch event! Agrint Sensing Solutions The company has adapted its sensor to detect the red palm weevil larvae, an insect causing catastrophic damage to palm trees worldwide. The ability to detect the weevil at a larval stage means the tree can be saved and pesticides are only applied to infested trees. Armenta Armenta developed the first non-antibiotic, noninvasive treatment using acoustic pulse therapy (APT). APT is a proprietary technology specifically adapted from human health care to be used in dairy farms. Biological responses to APT include, among others, angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, dispersion of pain mediator (substance P), and nerve regeneration. Beewise Their solution is based on artificial intelligence (AI) and modern robotics. These technologies enable complete streamlining of beekeeping, allowing bees to effectively produce honey and pollinate essential crops. The innovation in their system stems from the fact that we have completely redesigned the (150 year old!) existing beehives. ClariFruit They strive to create a global quality standard for the fresh produce industry by:- transforming the entire supply chain (grower > wholesaler > retailer > consumer) from offline onto the cloud- collecting, tracking, and analyzing data automatically (rather than manually as it is done today) to derive insights that would improve produce quality, optimize processes, and promote collaboration - enhancing revenue opportunities to supply-chain participants. eggXYt eggXYt’s mission is to enable a sustainable future in the livestock industry. eggXYt’s CRISPR-based technology allows 100% accurate, noninvasive (eggs are scanned through the shell), pre-incubation sex detection in chicken eggs, saving 7 billion male chicks from being unnecessarily hatched and killed each year, saving the industry billions of dollars, and adding 7 billion eggs to the global egg supply. eggXYt allows ethically sourced male-chick-culling-free eggs to reach the market, answering the demands of conscious egg consumers. Growee The company’s core product is a smart automated IoT device that monitors the plant’s environment and medium 24/7. The core product also includes a smart dosing system that auto-injects nutrients and pH solution according to sophisticated control algorithms and real-time data. The data collected from millions of growers will reveal the optimal grow protocols for each strain, allowing Growee to create the first true database of cannabis grow protocols. Metabolic Insights The Metabolic Insights technology platform enables very efficient discovery, prioritization and development system for plant-based molecules for crop protection industry. The company tackles one of the major challenges facing the natural products development: scale-up. Scale-up capabilities include know-how in compound identification, purification, and metabolic engineering.

I would like to thank my friend Aleksander Milanowski for helping me to asses what is needless here and sharing his editorial skills, to make this essay better. We are living in an era of historical change, defined by rapid technological progress. This change is driven by the Fourth Industrial Revolution which is defined by enormous progress in robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, quantum computing, biotechnology, The Internet of Things, 3D printing, big data and development of autonomous vehicles. The Fourth Industrial Revolution and further technological progress connected with it redefine the way we live, socialize, work, think about oneself and each other’s place in society. The social dimension of the Fourth Industrial Revolution cannot be omitted and warrants a deeper reflection. Special emphasis ought to be put on the main by-product of the occurring technological change. This technological development, and also the fuel for the contemporary economy, is massive amounts of data. Data as a new capital A classic definition of capital states that capital is every asset that can enhance one’s power to perform economically useful work and afford them revenue. The concept of capital was broadened by an embrace of immaterial means and also, from the perspective of teleological purpose of capital, by an embrace of indirectly material goals, which can be achieved by these different forms of capital. When we think about someone possessing a lot of capital, we think about prosperity, high social status and the ability to pursue one’s goals. Regardless of what kind of goals one pursues and which particular capital accumulating skill one possesses, the simple truth is that to attain these goals and accumulate capital it takes knowledge, which consists of data which one processed and understood. Prior to the information revolution, it was the vocation of professionals like lawyers, doctors, economists, journalists, and academicians to gather data relevant to their field and share this digested data as their insight and knowledge. Today we are witnessing their demise. Huge amounts of data harvested from devices create a new paradigm and revolutionize all aspects of our lives, including economics, labor market, and social interactions. We are starting to live in a world abundant with data. Data-based solutions and insight are slowly starting to outperform professionals in certain tasks. The benefits of a data-driven, digital economy are invaluable. Data-rich markets may be a useful tool to heal many illnesses of 21st Century capitalism. We need to start treating knowledge and data as commons and properly regulate the market in order to allow more entities to equally participate in it. We also need to mitigate harmful externalities of broad big data usage in our society. The dark side of Big Data and challenges ahead With the development and introduction of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, enormous amounts of data are gathered, including data about individuals. Data on geolocation, biometrics, the content of our messages, clicks and website visit patterns, queries which entered into search, phone records, political views, sexual preferences, spending history, social networks, are constantly gathered and used to infer knowledge about individuals. This dataisation of reality and replacement of culture by technology might cause humans to doubt their own agency and make them start seeing themselves as a mere node of data. This can undermine the belief in human subjectivity, human rights, and democracy. There is a danger of making humans mere objects of technological development. “Data is not a neutral impression of reality. The creation and consumption of data reflect how power is distributed in society”. In the near future, we can find ourselves in a scenario where artificial intelligence algorithms take control of our decisions and can target us, nudge us and manipulate us into choices which we would normally have not taken and which are not necessarily beneficial for us. Society needs to possess an ability to control this process, as even software engineers themselves are sometimes not aware of how their own algorithm came up to particular conclusions and to what extent these conclusions are true. There is an urgent need for transparency and control over these processes. Another economic and political issue to be solved is the concentration and monopolization of data. Unrestricted laissez-faire capitalism creates data monopolies, damaging healthy competition and society. The prospect of high-tech totalitarianism is also a real danger. The Chinese social credit score is just an example of what can lay ahead. If we want to avoid a Panopticon world19, where economic and political power is monopolized, the fruit of digital economy is available only to the few, democratic institutions are wiped out and deep surveillance is prevalent, we need to introduce bold and visionary solutions, fit for the new technological era we are entering right now. Common Data Sharing System (CDSS) and Personal Data Management Panel (PDMP) — evenly spread economic growth and privacy safeguard We need a multilayered approach towards data, which will provide us with both growth and privacy. In order to take back control over personal privacy and give everyone a chance to equally participate in a data-driven, digital economy, these two synergic institutions ought to be introduced. Common Data Sharing System (CDSS) is a collaborative commons platform and a tool to disclose and obtain access to relevant data from all public and private entities within society. CDSS is an intermediary between the private sector, the public sector, civil society, and individuals. Through CDSS, access to data will be given to everyone who needs it for lawful purposes. The disclosure of the majority of economically relevant data will be obligatory. Personal Data Management Panel (PDMP) is a personal platform, equipping individuals with a database, interface, AI data representative and assistance. Through PDMP individual will have access, insight, and control over who, when and how uses their data. PDMP will enable individuals to manage their data and decide whether their data ought to be shared or not. Structure and role of Common Data Sharing System (CDSS) CDSS will be a public law institution of public trust, which, within its jurisdiction, will have live, constant access to data possessed and processed by all entities storing defined kinds of data. The disclosure of data ought to be considered as a legal duty and form of a tax. CDSS will have knowledge of how data is used by an entity and for what purpose. Public authorities, which will be automatically monitoring and supervising whether data abuses are not being committed, will be exempt from the rule securing one’s right to not disclose certain data. CDSS will be the center of data flow and data sharing within its jurisdiction, preserving the transparency of data usage by all actors within society, including government. CDSS ought to be conceptualized and imagined as a specially crafted lens, put in the middle of data flows and data repositories, through which everyone can see what kind of data other entities have, but also be likewise seen. One will know what kind of data others possess, but one will not know how exactly this data is used by another entity. Access to CDSS will be achieved through a simple administrative procedure. The role of CDSS will consist of having a right to constantly, proactively monitor data flows and data repositories. The proper physical infrastructure needs to be rolled out in order to enable mutual, live disclosure of data and mutual access. CDSS can be introduced within the framework of the EU as a decentralized network and platform, based on blockchain. Structure and role of Personal Data Management Panel (PDMP) PDMPs will be AI interfaces, connected to CDSS, with which all individuals will be equipped. It will be PDMPs which will be the main gatherers of data about their owners and it will be through them that other entities will be able to ask for access to this data. PDMP’s will automatically gather individuals’ relevant data, they will, accordingly to the law and owners’ will, disclose data, and constantly monitor the use of one’s data. Data disclosed by PDMPs and then transferred through CDSS will be anonymized. The goal of this solution is individual privacy and control over data integrity. PDMP will contain an AI data representative, which will be automatically surveying for unlawful data abuse. Relevant laws will be coded into PDMP’s AI representative and automatically monitored. Based on PDMPs evidence and live data tracking, in a situation of data abuse the individual can withdraw his data from certain entities and sue. Data abuses also will be automatically marked by CDSS and punished administratively by fines or bans on certain data processing activities. PDMP will shield individuals from predatory and malicious data processing, abuse of data rights and will give individuals control over their data. Principles governing CDSS and PDMP The CDSS ought to be governed by principles of full transparency, disclosure of data, protection of certain intellectual property rights, protection of privacy, human rights and integrity. CDSS ought to be co-governed and managed not only by the government, companies, civil society, lawyers and relevant software engineers, but it also should engage as many stakeholders as possible in the process of creation, shaping, and management. PDMPs ought to be managed by users themselves, but their structure, the way their algorithms work ought to be transparent and under social control. The prerequisite and condition for the success of CDSS and PDMP is the introduction of relevant legislation, which will regulate the way data is gathered and used, broadening the scope of human rights by relevant data rights. These rights shall include the right of a person to be secure against unreasonable surveillance, the right of a person not to be surreptitiously manipulated and the right of the person to not be unfairly discriminated against on the basis of data. Both access to CDSS and possession of PDMP ought to be considered as individual rights. The whole system ought to be financed publicly. Call to action In order to secure privacy, human integrity and agency there is an urgent need for more social and democratic supervision over how data is gathered and processed by both business and government. Simultaneously, in order to boost economic growth, improve competitiveness and avoid further development of harmful monopolies, there is a need to spread data accessibility much further, making data-rich markets an equitable reality. Everyone capable ought to have a chance to compete and bring value to society. The world and a future in which we will use the benefits of data-driven the economy to the full extent while enjoying our privacy and related rights is possible, attainable and worth striving for.

https://medium.com/redpoint-ventures/is-high-quality-verticalized-healthcare-the-future-9c6b3079ca18?source=tag_archive---------37-----------------------,Is High Quality Verticalized Healthcare the Future?,Published in Redpoint Ventures,Medha Agarwal,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Medha Agarwal Follow Redpoint Ventures -- 2 Listen Share I’ve previously written about the crisis of rapidly rising drug discovery costs and the need for data driven innovation as well as the growing opportunity in senior care. I also have longed believed that we are at a crisis point in healthcare delivery but was skeptical that it was possible to drive change in this sector given its complexity and the multi-faceted stakeholder dynamics between payers, providers, and patients. I have come to believe that though it will be hard, if done right it is not impossible. Below I lay out why we desperately need change as well as the market and business model characteristics that I believe will best set up companies trying navigate this unique industry. Why? US healthcare spend is 17.9% of GDP and growing. That means that for every $5 spent in the US, almost $1 is on healthcare. Spend reached a whopping $3.5T in 2017. To put this in perspective, other wealthy countries spend about half as much per person on average on health than the U.S. spends. Despite being a top 5 area of spend by GDP, consumer NPS (net promoter score, a metric of consumer satisfaction) of the US healthcare industry is terrible. The chart below illustrates how health plans trail almost all industries, even the widely hated wireless carriers and barely rank above utilities providers. Similarly, when asked about their level of dissatisfaction with their most recent experience across several industries, consumers rated health insurance companies and providers as the highest in terms of dissatisfaction. In fact, not only is satisfaction low, but so are outcomes. Among comparable developed countries, the US ranks at the bottom in terms of life expectancy. Of course, there are many factors that affect these statistics, but one would hope that given both the absolute amount and percentage of spend on healthcare, Americans would rank higher among their peer countries. Consumer Expectations Americans today are no longer just patients, but consumers of healthcare. They no longer think this status quo is acceptable. People are more selective and have higher expectations. In a 2017 McKinsey consumer health survey, respondents clearly illustrate that they would like to be better healthcare consumers. They want to make informed decisions about the care they receive and how best to address their needs (e.g., affordability) but most also said they do not believe they can do that today. Similarly, in a 2016 consumer healthcare survey, Deloitte concluded that patients are demanding (1) greater personalization; (2) transparency in network coverage, medical prices, and bills; (3) convenience; and more (4) engaging digital experiences and capabilities. From doctor’s appointments to lab visits and even hospitalizations, consumers seek high quality service tailored to their specific needs. According to Deloitte’s Survey of US Health Care Consumers, 75% of consumers want to partner with their providers to determine the most effective treatment decisions. 1 in 3 consumers even wants their provider to push them to be more active in researching and questioning their prescribed treatments. In the same McKinsey study, when asked what companies healthcare organizations should emulate, respondents responded customer-centric leaders like Amazon, Google, Apple, Chick-fil-A and Walmart. These responses clearly illustrate the quality of interaction and experience they would like to see from their healthcare providers. So What’s Next? I believe that traditional healthcare organizations and providers are likely structurally unable to adapt rapidly enough to these demands, leaving an opportunity for new consumer-focused verticalized healthcare entrants to gain share. These companies approach the problem in different ways and have a wide variety of business models. But they all have 4 important characteristics in common: they are (1) focusing on a single, traditionally underserved segment of healthcare (2) that is predominantly cash pay. They are (3) creating a high quality experience focused on the consumer that (4) still drives long term cost savings. As a caveat, I believe that the target vertical has to be broad and important enough that consumers, payers, and/or providers are willing to engage with a specialized solution among their myriad of other healthcare touch points but specific enough to be able to be best in class in that category on a startup’s budget. In addition, the traditional cash pay characteristics are key because consumers and/or employers have predominantly paid for the service “out of pocket” and therefore are willing to continue to do so. This is important because it allows for timely customer acquisition, without the black hole of insurer relationships. Our investment in hims is a great example of this. hims is highly focused on its segment of men’s wellness with a customer centric, lower cost approach paid for out of pocket by consumers. At Redpoint, we have spent time looking at a few such categories with strong tailwinds and the right stakeholder dynamics, but believe there could be opportunities across other specialties as well. Some sectors and disruptive companies with impressive founders include: Some of these companies are approaching the problem from a B2B2C perspective while others are going B2C. In either case, we believe there are opportunities to provide value and create a large business if done right. Similarly, given consumers’ desire for more ownership over their decisions we believe there will be a rise of companies providing data transparency and ownership across categories like Ciitizen and Picnic Health for health records as well as health apps like Cardiogram, Apple Health, Pillow and others. In addition to the categories above, consumers are increasingly concerned with their diets, exercise, and sleep and large companies will be built enabling them to do so. If you’re building a disruptive company in healthcare and my perspective above resonates, I would love to hear from you. Am I missing any companies above?

https://medium.com/@jayden.dtran/what-is-product-management-tech-1883a55b0115?source=tag_archive---------57-----------------------,What is Product Management? (Tech),Written by Jayden T,Jayden T,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jayden T Follow -- Listen Share Are you a college student? Does the idea of getting a job at the likes of Google and Facebook excite you? Did you chance across this kind of openings titled “Junior/Senior Product Manager” on LinkedIn, not knowing what they are? Or maybe you’re looking for a career switch and heard from your friend about Product Management (PM) being the new “in” thing. While there are already tons of articles online answering your questions, they definitely did not do it for me when I was in your position. The goal of this article is to shed some lights from my personal perspective, hoping it can be useful to some. WHAT IS PRODUCT MANAGEMENT?Product: Product here refers to a computer software, either consumer-facing like Windows OS, Facebook, TikTok, or business-only software like Xero accounting software, or Point-of-Sale (POS) software. Management: Means the authority and responsibility to plan and decide what happens to the products mentioned above. Key word is “manage”. The PM does not do everything him/herself to create and maintain a product. Multiple teams are involved (developers, project managers, operations team, marketing team, business development teams) in this process. Example: Instagram Story Maybe somebody in IG had an idea, “how about allowing our users to record their daily experience and share with their friends?” The Product Management is the process of:1. Taking that idea of Insta Story, evaluate it thoroughly, pros, cons, should we do it? 2. If yes we should do it, how should we do it? Visualize the feature, and make a wireframe/mockup of how it is supposed to look/feel like (Small parts of an expansive, complex software/system, are referred to as “Features”) 3. Review and re-iterate the design continuously, with business team, design team, and tech team. What should be the buttons available, how should the UI look like? Are we doing text, sticker, filters? 4. Develop, test, and release it to the wild wild west of production environment 5. Listen to user experience complaints and try to fix your feature, re-iterate. This 5-step process is Product Management. It might be led by either the Product Manager end-to-end, or by others for some parts, really, it varies for each company. You may hear Product Management going hand-in-hand with Product Development. PM is heavily involved in step 1, 2, 3, and 5. Product Development is heavily involved under step 3, 4, 5. PMs and developers work closely in bringing the features to life, and make sure it is well-maintained. HOW DOES PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FIT IN A (TECH) COMPANY I want to address 2 common impression: 1. Only Tech companies have PMs FALSE. Any company that has its own software, even if only for internal use, will have developers, and with that, Product Managers. Example: Just a few years back, General Motors (GM) cut their IT outsource contract with HP, to bring it in-house. They created their own internal services for many things. For big companies like GM, or even banks like JP Morgan, or Deutsch Bank, making software in-house allow them to stay cost-effective in the long-run. There is also a greater sense of data-security as these data does not leave the company’s servers. This is especially relevant for industries where operational data, or customer privacy is essential to companies’ survival. 2. In Tech companies, the features drive the business, YES AND NO. Companies, like human, are snowflakes. No two are the same People say product is the heart and soul of any tech company, and holds the key to everything. This is where the saying comes in, “Your milage may vary”. In some companies, the product and dev teams continuously push for new ideas, and ground-breaking features. This gives the business teams the tool they need to go out and market to audience “Hey I got something new and cool that nobody else has!” In others, the business teams are very strong, with their creative ideas on how to acquire more customers, engage them, providing benefits to users. They are experience-centric, and user-centric. At these places, the product and dev teams play more of a support role, to enable the business teams to do what they want to do. You can see how it can vary by company and industries. WHAT DOES A PRODUCT MANAGER DO DAILY? Send emails, and attend meetings. Really! That’s about most of my days in the office! Of course there is also proper documentation of our features with Business Requirement Document/Technical Requirement Document/the likes You have probably seen the below illustration in every other search result. And it is because it is true. A PM has to concern himself with the user experience, the technical design, and the business impact that it brings about The short-version is essentially the same as the 5-step of Product Management and Development I stated above. A PM receives business request to do a feature. The PM then discuss and document the requirements in detail with Biz team. Then PM prepare the feature design, and review with developers and designers. Once development is done, PM takes the feature to let users do testing, and get it ready to deliver to end-users. After the product is done, the PM’s job is not done yet. A PM usually has to follow up with his products during its life-cycle, or provide assistance to other PMs, whose work may interact with his/her previous products. This is the short-version. If you are keen to know more, I included a more detailed work flow at the bottom annex. WHAT IS THE PRE-REQUISITE TO BE A PRODUCT MANAGER? So this is another extremely popular question from my experience. How can a student prepare for the role of Product Management? Do I have what it takes to apply for this job? I graduated from uni with a degree in Biz Management, and a professional Accounting degree. I started working in Big4 Mergers & Acquisitions for a while, before dropping out to find more meaning to my daily work. I stumbled upon the opportunity to become a PM, and my personal interest and background happened to line up. Firstly, my example is one of many to show that PM does not require a specific degree. PM is probably a field with one of the most diverse background mix. I have seen chemical engineers, structural engineers, accountants, generic business degree, etc, joining the ranks of Product Managers. It is note worthy that there are proportionately more PM from certain degrees such as Computer Science, or Information Systems, than others. However, rest assured that you will have your own advantage on the table wherever you come from. Secondly, I want to say that PM requires a combination of traits. Hence with any degree, having one or more of these traits can already put you in the track for a PM role: I will add more skills as I find them to be essential. But these are the core traits off the top of my head CLOSING NOTE This is a lengthy read, and I do hope it can be of help to those interested in knowing what Product Management is about. Feel free to ask any question and I will try to answer. Cheers.

After Amir followed Mr. Lee to his office, they had a nostalgic reunion. But, there is something odd about Mr. Lee. “Well, that is quite true,” Amir replied in a softer voice. “A good balance of surveillance is useful nowadays to maintain peace and security.” For some reason, he felt awkward. He used to love hearing Mr. Lee explain his thoughts on things because he was always logical and reasonable. But that feeling of excitement had vanished. He couldn’t tell exactly why. “I wanted to ask for your opinion,” Amir paused as soon as he saw Mr. Lee looking straight at him before continuing his sentence, “just like the old times.” “Those were really good days,” Mr. Lee smiled slightly. “Tell me about it.” “Y… You see, I had a friend. She got scolded because of something I did. You know I am not good at dealing with people. What should I do?” “Do you regret what you did?” Amir thought for a while before answering the question, “I felt a bit guilty that I got someone in trouble, but I don’t regret what I did. Does that mean I am a bad person? Like a criminal?” “No! You are not a bad person. You will not be a criminal! You know what, Amir? Sometimes, we have to be a bit selfish to get what we want to achieve. Even if that means stepping a bit on people because they would definitely do the same to you.” “Isn’t it wrong? Someone else got punished for something I did.” “Nothing… nothing is wrong if what you did is something that will give you good results.” The school bell rang. Amir immediately stood up. “I am sorry, I will be back another time,” Amir said and walked towards the door. “Amir, do come back soon. I would love to continue our mentorship if you want.” Amir simply looked back at him. “I know it’s been a while, but let’s try to put back the harmonious days, shall we?” Mr. Lee continued, breaking the awkward air between them. Amir nodded his head in response and headed out, closing the door behind him. He walked back to his classroom then took his seat. “I should feel happy, right? This is a trusty mentor I am talking about,” Amir thought. “But, what is this feeling?” His thoughts flashed back to an old conversation he had with Mr. Lee when he was younger. A younger Amir knocked on the door of the faculty room. “Mr. Lee?” “Come in, Amir,” as he gestured the young boy to come in. “I… I got a classmate in trouble. She was scolded by the new Math teacher because I took her homework.” “Why did you take it?” “I…I didn’t want to get a failing grade,” a younger Amir lowered his head as he explained. Mr. Lee tapped his shoulder. In response, he said, “It’s good that you wanted to maintain good grades and you know it’s always wrong to use someone else for that matter. But, sometimes, we just have to go beyond the rules to get…” Mr. Lee paused. He looked out the window with distant eyes.

An era when retailers made satisfying income by selling their products in boots and stands. An era where retailers stayed in control and were able to maintain a guaranteed true identity to merchants. Customers patronizing the products knew their merchants and acknowledge not only because of the identity but also how merchants producing self-products were able to perceive customers interests. Local entrepreneurs and merchants believed and practiced a productive character which stood in as a base for capital inflow. These characters were about how to perceive, present and showcase products. Hurray, the Digital Age stepped in. Change strongly expatiates new opportunities and these opportunities varies. With all of its benefits, gradual growth and technology, man has been able to achieve simplicity and productivity; From daily assessments, maintenance, risk reduction, challenges to cost reduction. The introduction of change has conclusively not been benefiting to all, in spite of whatever benefits is associated with it. You don’t need to be told that most perks have its injuries also. Digitalisation surely did a great deal to how merchants produce and sell their products and also how we customers shop. Truth be told, small entrepreneurs and merchants face the risk of losing than profiting within this era. With competition driving the market, small merchants with the inability and resourceless power to compete have little or no choice but to engage under rules delegated by powerful forces. These forces are known to be the Online Goliath — the Jumia, eBay and other online shopping platforms. Expenses may not deprive small merchants to begin as retailers under these successful platforms, yet it’s a gamble — a less beneficiary field, a game of win and loose, where a win is relatively minute. And why is that? Ownership of digital assets. Small businesses may no longer have the power to own or control their digital store market plan. Instead, the platforms do own it. They control the market, the process, they practically have the final say regarding whatsoever. Online shopping platforms owning all digital assets have the power to control and tamper every single fragment of digital assets within their platforms. Have you used one of the various online shopping platforms? Check them out if you haven’t. Images, videos, descriptions, reviews, comments and support are the listed attributes of these digital assets owned by a small business retailer registered under a platform. An input format is presented to a seller account which should include how the products are presented and displayed. With huge leverage over individual businesses, these platforms attain benefits never directed to them. How? As long as these small retailers have no access and control over their digital assets, some of their algorithms are been manipulated to a custom best favorable to the online platform been registered. How can one ascertain if a search on a product which is meant to filter out your product is being manipulated? How is one sure a product price is exactly as it was inputted when registering the product? How is one sure the reviews made by a satisfied customer is been directed to the merchant or tampered with? Hasn’t recommendations of a product and pop-up ads redirected the choice of a potential customer away from your product for sale? Is the platform favoring a set of product, leaving yours behind? Is the method of payment for a product been re-adjusted to suit the platform? Has the Terms and Conditions been modified without the merchant’s knowledge? Or the periodical subscription has been increased and deducted without the merchant's knowledge? and much more we don’t know. How much more can a retailer endure this level of cruel unfairness? We can also talk about the perks of the digital age, or let’s say the perks of Existence of the Blockchain over product behavior and control over data which is centered around Ownership over self-sovereign digital assets. The next stage in the evolution of E-commerce: Decentralization, Transparency and Ownership of digital assets. With the Blockchain, ownership and control over one's own digital assets has proved to be more imperative in this modern age. For example, the ability to own and control the entire market of self-owned products has a great impact in today’s e-commerce environment. For a retailer, there’s nothing more satisfying as having the means to direct and adjust one's market window to model the constant inflow of profits, rewards and benefits. A trustless and transparent environment which is one of the attributes of the blockchain technology supports the ownership of digital assets to product and project individuals, modeling and adjusting as they deem fit. Are there blockchain projects under development or already running tackling this issue? Not permanently but gradually reducing the level of unfairness in e-commerce eco-system?

https://medium.com/processmaker/ibpm-vs-traditional-bpm-2ba776bea1b3?source=tag_archive---------134-----------------------,iBPM vs. Traditional BPM,What’s the difference?,Matthieu McClintock,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Matthieu McClintock Follow ProcessMaker -- Listen Share With the onset of rapidly-developing new technology, business process management (BPM) software is moving in a new direction: iBPM. iBPM stands for “intelligent Business Process Management” and involves the integration of cutting-edge technology, such as robotic process automation (RPA) and machine learning, into everyday processes. The goal of iBPM is to leverage cutting-edge technology to produce automated, meaningful data analysis to better automate processes and improve efficiency. Since it is still new, the difference between iBPM and traditional BPM platforms can be hard to grasp. How is iBPM more “intelligent” than traditional BPM suites? This blog post explores how iBPM differs from traditional BPM and how those differences affect workflows. iBPM’s greatest strength is to compile data from both users and integrated applications and use it make informed, automated decisions. This is a significant difference from traditional BPM software. There are two common problems when it comes to traditional BPM platforms and data: Although traditional BPM platforms help companies optimize workflows by collecting data on process and employee efficiency, the time to convert data into results is significant. iBPM tackles the first problem through its seamless integration with cutting-edge technology to automatically analyze data and optimize workflows. Integrating outside technology and applications into traditional BPM processes often requires a dedicated team of programmers to build custom solutions. In contrast, iBPM software orchestrates multiple applications to weave innovative, cutting-edge technologies seamlessly into workflows. By incorporating new technology like event-processing and predictive analytics into workflows, the time it takes to act on insight gathered from process data is drastically reduced. Two main benefits stem from the quick conversion from insight to improvement: better exception handling and continuous process optimization. iBPM predicts problems and changes the workflow correspondingly based on real-time data. This expands the scope of BPM software to automate processes that are prone to exceptions. It also generates more data about changes made to continuously improve processes. This way, process data continuously feeds back on itself so workflows are constantly improved over time. The impact of advanced data processing is enhanced by the ability to rapidly change processes. iBPM platforms give users the option to not only make changes automatically through event-driven architecture, but also features low-code design interfaces that allow even citizen developers to modify processes. This is a big step from needing a dedicated team of IT professionals to deploy process changes over a series of months, as in traditional BPM software. In iBPM, both technology and citizen developers can make modifications to workflows based on accurate data. As a result, companies rely less on IT staff to monitor processes and experience lower costs, risk and deployment times. iBPM’s ability to leverage cutting-edge business intelligence technology while lowering the barrier to process development makes it a powerful tool for experimenting with business models. iBPM simultaneously generates and performs accurate analysis on an increased amount of data through integrations with cutting-edge technology. Combined with the ability to change processes at will, professionals have the freedom to make informed decisions about business strategy. Then, act on those decisions without taking on significant risk. By aligning technology, data, and strategy, companies experience increased efficiency at a much faster rate and a much lower cost. While some BPM software providers are starting to implement iBPM capabilities, years remain before it becomes the standard. The technology that makes it possible to automate decision making and data analysis has not fully matured. However, as cutting-edge business intelligence (BI) technology matures, BPM software will start to resemble true iBPM platforms. As iBPM proliferates in the market, exciting possibilities are in store for organizations of all sizes to rapidly transform their businesses through intelligent process automation and optimization.

It was named Bedin 1 — and it’s almost as old as our Universe. This unexpected discovery was made while scientists were studying the white dwarfs that make up the globular cluster of stars NGC 6752. The purpose of these observations was to determine the age of the globular cluster. According to experts, the interest of discovery is that it’s a low-luminosity galaxy far away from giant galaxies. Astronomers were using the Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys, and they have seen a compact group of stars. After careful analysis of their brightness and temperature, scientists have concluded that these stars do not belong to a cluster — which is part of the Milky Way. New Galaxy Bedin 1 is about 30 million light-years from the Milky Way and differs from other galaxies of this class, primarily by its solitude — the largest galaxy closest to it, NGC 6744, is 2 million light-years away. This makes the Bedin 1 galaxy a bit of a time capsule preserving the conditions of the early Universe. Bedin 1 is a small elongated galaxy. Its largest dimension is estimated at 3,000 light years. Galaxy Bedin 1 is not only tiny, but extremely dim. Based on the light it emits, the team was able to determine that there are very few metals in the galaxy. The low metal content implies that Bedin 1 was the result of an explosion, and since then it has not had a new star formation, which indicates that Bedin 1 has a very old star population. All of these properties gave astronomers reason to classify it as a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. According to the Professor of the Department of Stellar Astrophysics, the Sternberg State Astronomical Institute of the Moscow State University Anatoly Zasov, this galaxy was opened at a great distance, and in this respect it is a kind of record holder. “The discovery of a new galaxy is putting it a bit strongly, we can talk about the discovery of a galaxy with special properties. Its feature is its type — a dwarf spheroidal galaxy. As a rule, such galaxies are observed not far from giant galaxies. And this one, discovered accidentally, turned out to be isolated; there are no large galaxies near it. Galaxies of this type are known, there are only a few of them, but usually they are rarely found so far from the galaxies of giants. It is believed that such galaxies have a low brightness because they interacted with the matter of other galaxies, and when it is isolated, this explanation does not fit — this is of interest,” Anatoly Zasov told to Asgardia Space News. According to astronomers, the Bedin 1 dwarf spheroidal galaxy is about 13 billion years old — add only 0.8 billion years, and it will be as old as the Universe itself.

Wife to six men. Mother to three, who in her spare time pursued the passion of her life: the invention of things. At a time when a woman’s role in the world was very much set in stone and free-thought circumscribed, she broke the boundaries of her gender. Today, she is half forgotten, a faint echo of history against the cacophony of the #MeToo movement and others, where at least women have a voice at last. ‘I think it’s very important to get more women into computing. My slogan is: Computing is too important to be left to men.’ — Karen Spärck Jones Hedy Lamarr, born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler, emigrated to the United States in her early twenties where she lit up Hollywood with her looks and star appeal. Before all that, however, she used to do experiments at home as a child, encouraged by the most important man in her life, her father, whom she idolized. After taking acting classes as a young woman, she eventually starred in Gustav Machatý’s controversial film Ecstasy, in 1933. She then briefly stayed in Paris, before moving to London, where her future was sealed: it was there she met Louis B. Mayer, the Russian-born American film producer as well as co-founder of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios (MGM). Smitten by her beauty and charisma, he offered her a film contract in Hollywood. She became a bona fide star with great performances in movies such as Algiers and Boom Town, in the latter starring alongside Hollywood icons Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable. Between other films, she was a wartime fundraiser, using her profile to sell war bonds while also establishing her own production company. However, Lamarr was focusing her mind on something grander, something which she thought was of much more importance: inventing. Lacking in any formal scientific education, the Hollywood starlet got down to work with such diverse projects as creating a tablet that when dissolved in water turned into a soft drink and improving the functionality of traffic stoplights. To the eccentric aviation tycoon Howard Hughes, too, whom she dated for some time, she offered assistance, consulting him on the shape of his planes. She suggested, having got the idea from studying the movements of fish and birds in nature, to streamline them. Happy with her input, the billionaire allowed his team of scientists and designers to work with her on her own ideas. Her greatest idea, nevertheless, was in conjunction with her friend, the pianist George Antheil. They worked on a secret communication system of frequency-hopping. This invention, brought about after the two had been talking on the subject of torpedoes one day, was a precursor to Wifi and Bluetooth technologies. This device could jam signals between the torpedo and the control centre. Already knowledgeable on the technology of torpedoes from her ex-husband, Friedrich Mandl, who had been the chairman of Hirtenberger Patronen-Fabrik, an Austrian armaments factory, she set to work with Antheil on an invention to block torpedo signals from transmission to reception. Rabidly patriotic to her new homeland during the Second World War, Lamarr recognized the importance of such technology — it could save countless lives in the Battle of the Atlantic, where German u-boats were destroying scores of Allied ships, which in turn killed thousands of people. Her mind had humanitarian intentions from the very beginning. In 1941, Lamarr and her co-inventor got their invention patented; sadly, however, it was not immediately taken up by either the US Air Force or the Navy. Not until two decades later, and during the Cuban Missile Crisis, did U.S. Patent 2,292,387 see the light of day. It is hard to believe that their work together and Lamarr’s dedication to her art, would one day spawn digital communications like wireless technologies and mobile phones. The recognition she received for her innovation and intelligence — in contrast to male inventors of that time and since — has been wanting for the most part. Yet what do we expect when gender equality, though unimaginably better than a century ago, is still in need of vast improvement. It was not until the late 1990s that the 83-year-old Lamarr got due recognition for her efforts, receiving an Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Pioneer Award. The icing on the cake, nonetheless, came in the same year, when she won what many call the Oscar of inventing, the BULBIE™ Gnass Spirit of Achievement Award. A woman of such beauty, star appeal, intelligence, and vision is rare in life. What makes it more appealing, though, is that many people close to her didn’t have a clue what she was up to. Her humility is admirable. There are, it must be said, women whose accomplishments in the fields of science and innovation have left a greater mark on humanity than Lamarr’s, yet it has been the versatility of the Austrian’s talents that is impressive above all else. Women have split atoms, discovered radioactivity, come up with ice-cream makers, invented thermoelectric power generators, conceived early computers at Harvard and studied subatomic particles which have led to technologies like fibre optic cables and portables faxes. What more do you want? So Lamarr can stand proudly beside the Curies, Johnsons, Hoppers, and Jacksons of this world, whose achievements compare to any man’s from any era.

Reducing greenhouse gases caused by the transport sector is one of the imperatives to avoid negative effects of climate change and improve urban air quality in line with the Paris Agreement. Trends transforming mobility and parking Behind the undergoing revolution in transport there are trends impacting mobility, and thus changing the role of parking. There are four main forces and technologies shaping the future of mobility: Autonomous, Connected, Electric, and Shared vehicles (shortened to the acronym ACES). All of them — especially taken together, will redefine the role of parking infrastructure. The major changes will refer to more efficient parking finding enabled by smart parking technologies, adoption of parking infrastructure for EV charging stations, as well as for parking dedicated to shared and on-demand mobility modes (bikes, scooters, carsharing pick-up and drop-off spots). Another aspect which will indirectly imply transformation of parking role is a demographic one. Namely, Millennials (born between 1982 and 2003) who will dominate the next decades in using urban transport — will demand interconnected transport modes able to satisfy their multi-modal and on-demand lifestyle. This implies the necessity to consolidate all the mobility options available in the city and creation of mobility hubs (parkings) to enable seamless link between first and last mile. Even with reduction of cars in the city centers, trips by car (whether shared, autonomous or electric) will maintain an important mode of transport — at least in some parts of the journey, especially considering so called “mobility deserts” underserved by public transport. Micromobility options like shared bikes or electric scooters, are often expected to be parked at docks in dedicated spaces. They are seen as a remedy for short-duration travels and first/last mile transport. According to McKinsey & Company, integrated transport modes could accommodate up to 30% more passengers, reduce average time per trip by 10% and (if AVs are electric), reduce GHG emissions by up to 85%[1]. Apart from being less dependent on cars, Millennials are more environmentally-conscious, and when making mobility decisions they can consider the carbon footprint. In curbing transport emissions, both electromobility and smart parking technologies have their role, contributing to more sustainable mobility: EV — directly, Smart Parking — indirectly, cutting the time of idling and circling in search for a parking spot. Better availability of parking spaces and transport options by making them visible in the application, allows end-to-end trip planning, resulting in optimized, more balanced mobility. With further integration of all transit options provided by public authorities and private transport operators into one Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) tool, the users will be able to assess their impact on the environment related to using different mobility options, and choose more eco-friendly ones. Carbon-neutral city centers As transport industry accounts for 21% of all CO2 emissions, cities are introducing a range of mitigating actions in order to meet the Paris Agreement goals of keeping global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius. The EU long-term strategy is to curb its emissions by 80–95% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050. Satisfying mobility needs of the growing urban population while meeting objectives from environmental and energy perspective, requires from current mobility services to become more efficient and more sustainable. Strategic Urban Mobility plans addressing the objectives to achieve low-emission transport, should concentrate on the following aspects: · Expanding and improving existing transit network · Optimizing freight movement · Transport modes integration (including first and last mile mobility) · Adoption of less polluting means of transport such as electric mobility and micromobility as a greener alternative to private cars · Promoting sustainable ways of moving around. Decarbonization of cities is a long-term strategy where electrification of transport plays a crucial role. For example, Amsterdam set the targets for taxis, vans, and freight trucks to be emission free by 2025. Although electric mobility has started breaking into the mainstream, there are still many challenges to address on a strategic and operational level. Those are: COSTS associated with the new industry, in particular investments in the provision of electric charging stations. Countries introduce financial and non-financial incentives for EVs buyers like higher amortisation rates for company vehicles, exemption from excise tax, parking fees. Additionally, new parking locations in a city should be EV ready and have designated EV-specific parking spaces. As the home is the primary charging location for most electric vehicles[2], cities should incentivize installation of EVs technology in private buildings. This could benefit not only personal vehicle owners, but also third-party users, commercial fleets — if the access to charging point and selling energy by private owners is permitted. SUSTAINABLE FREIGHT Urban freight logistics contributes significantly to the total CO2 city traffic emissions. To achieve CO2-free city logistics, the city should work closely with commercial industry and encourage logistics companies to adopt EVs (vans and trucks). The purchase of company EVs has a large share in the whole purchase power for EVs. For instance, fleet and business clients bought 70% of the cars sold in Poland in 2017. To integrate urban logistics in e-mobility there are challenges to overcome from planning perspective regarding to provision of recharging stations considering distribution routes and the limited driving-range capabilities of EVs. Decisions have to be made about the location, number and capacity of the stations. As charging and discharging (in the Vehicle-to-Grid scenario) of EVs takes place at the parking facilities — they will play an important role in transformation to emission-free inner city delivery. To mitigate the impact of trucks on congestions, emissions and noise in a city, new forms of cooperation should be created: cross-company, cross-sectoral and multi-institutional where parking facilities can serve as Green City Hubs — enabling to reload goods to vehicles with alternative drive, e-cargo bikes which are becoming more efficient for last mile transport and they can get closer to delivery point than vans. Therefore, new business models for fleet operators, fleet management, vehicle routing, charging strategy, parking access control and parking management are needed to support last mile logistics and delivery on demand from parkings having its new role — multimodal mobility hubs. Parking lots dedicated for such hubs should be used as shared-hubs in order to optimize their utilization, beyond only limited time of exploitation during reloading. At the same time, cities should consider policies regulating curbside access for logistics EVs and encouraging off-peak hours of operations. Providing smart parking solutions to easy wayfinding to parking (and charging point, in case of EVs) will increase both the comfort for drivers and the efficiency for towns and municipalities. The technology can be applied not only for logistics companies but also for taxi corporations with electric cars fleet, municipal fleet or touristic buses entering city center. Smart City Wroclaw implemented, in cooperation with NaviParking, the tool for touristic bus drivers guiding them to the closest available bus parking — temporary (up to 15 minutes to drop off tourists) and permanent with no time restrictions. This way the city can reduce unnecessary driving and limit GHG emissions — which his particularly important giving the engine power of buses. NEW BUSINESS MODELS Giving complexity of the transport and energy ecosystem, encompassing transport network companies, electricity suppliers, automotive industry, fleet operators, charging and parking infrastructure, horizontal cooperation among stakeholders is required. The question is not whether partnerships will happen or when, but what are the most optimal models to collaborate in order to provide urbanites with seamless mobility and green mobility options. As McKinsey report points out, the basis for seamless mobility of the future is physical infrastructure (roads, stations, rail, parking facilities) and the energy infrastructure powering it[3]. And because physical infrastructure is being digitalized, it should be interconnected and equipped with innovative technologies making it possible to respond to changing mobility (and electric) demand, assuring electricity and parking spot availability. Meeting growing demand for EV charging in peak times, may need to utilize EV charging spots located at private and residential areas, as well as developing energy storage, utilizing Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. V2G and Smart charging, especially for public and commercial fleet, can support lower price for electricity by charging when electricity prices from renewable energy are low and stop charging (return stored electricity to the grid) when demand for electricity is high. V2G can reduce temporary fluctuations in energy production and works as a reserve system for the public grid. Last October Nissan Leaf was qualified to be used as a reserve for the German electricity grid. On top of that, there are profitable business cases to charge premium above the retail electricity prices — in cases where users pay for the electricity and assuming high levels of utilization. In the context of multimodal transport, including shared, on-demand mobility and in the future — autonomous vehicles — parking infrastructure (both public and private) can be digitally, in real-time allocated to: · Pick-up / drop-off areas for on-demand mobility · Charge/Recharge for EVs and V2G uses cases · Reload at last-mile delivery hubs for logistics · Connect with alternative and green modes of transport (first and last mile switching point) · Parking behind the Low-Emission Zones. Therefore, new ecosystem of partnerships for electromobility transition has to be created, that will integrate users, stakeholders and — what is crucial — enable data sharing between them. NEW MOBILITY SERVICES With the introduction of zero emission zones or (Ultra Low Emission Zones) and potentially curbing physical places dedicated for parking, the existing parking and curb infrastructure, should be used more efficiently. Underutilized parking spaces about which drivers do not know they exist, difficult to find or access to which is closed, should be more effectively used and allocated dynamically for those who need them at the moment. Similarly, with the growth of electric cars popularity, the demand for charging stations can be responded if added to the repository of actual public chargers, also EV charging stations located on the private premises. The Netherlands, which is one of the countries leading in EVs adoption, already started considering usage of private parkings for EV chargers installations. In recent months, the number of charging sessions in that country increased 50%. Also, more kWh was used, which can be related to increase in number of fully electric cars (with higher battery capacity than hybrid cars bought by early adopters at the beginning of the EV trend). As 70% of Dutch people do not have access to their own charging point, they have to rely on publicly available chargers — which number and capacity may not suffice to meet a growing demand and assure accessibility when needed. Another idea which could help to optimize EV chargers usage is notifying (by push message) the EV car owner that the battery is full — therefore they can come and release EV parking space for their neighbor. This also implies that there must be other parking spots available in order not to block the space dedicated for EV charging. In described cases, private and commercial parkings could serve as repository of available parking and charging spots — shared when the facility users do not occupy them (for instance parking lot which stays empty after working hours). But how to access those facilities? Disruptive mobility innovations provide the answer — the entry to the closed car park, as well as the payment for parking and energy can be done with the use of a smartphone application. The pioneering project providing such functionalities, is recently being tested in Poland. The concept was developed by NaviParking in cooperation with The Intelligent Mobility for Energy Transition (IMET)initiative and the Polish Academy of Sciences. The concept is simple: NaviParking application communicates with the IoT Access Controller installed in the parking gate barrier and opens it for registered users with one tap in the app. Payments for charging and parking time are meant to be carried out in the application — through PCI DSS compliant gateway for transactions. After the payment is recorded, the user can leave the parking pushing the same “Open barrier” button in the application. The service, which plans to partner with taxi corporation owning electric fleet, offers fully digital experience benefiting all stakeholders — those looking for a place to park and charge, the parking owners, and the city relieved of cars circling block. Further, those parkings can be integrated with shared electric bikes/scooters platform, fleet management and become mobility hubs. At the same time, encouraging mobility partners to cooperate within a common data platform is an effort to promote open innovation and adoption of vertical Smart City solutions, open to integration with other third-party platforms and components (whether related to transport, energy or smart buildings use cases). Additional goal of that pilot project is monetization of the Polish Academy of Sciences’ parking facilities from sharing parking spots which are currently suboptimally used — left empty after academic working hours. An important feature from the point of view of a replication of the solution at other institutional and commercial parking lots is that the parking owner maintains in the full control regarding to how many parking spots they want to make available for external users at a given moment. Using desktop dashboard they can control (add or reduce) parking spots “visible” in the application for other (than academicians and institute guests) users, as well as monitor actual occupancy and invoicing. OPEN APIs AND STANDARIZATION To enable new business models to thrive, interoperability and Open Data sharing are a prerequisite. This is a big challenge, as currently city data portals are often proprietary, siloed and with poor data quality. Historic data in the form of static “data cementeries” is often outdated, and cities lack IT infrastructure and sufficient technical skills to upload, update, aggregate and share data. The value of historic data can be leveraged for transport management, when it is merged with comprehensive real-time data. Also, parking industry is fragmented with lots of proprietary, old-legacy systems non-integratable with third-party data. In addition, integration of data into APIs lacks uniformity, which implies also that there is no uniform-data sharing for trip planning/Mobility-as-a-Service platforms creation. To overcome that challenge, local governments’ procurement can enforceopen-by-default data sharing regulation to facilitate integration of existing services in the form of multimodal transport where parking policy plays an important role in optimizing urban traffic. Standarization and Open APIs are also necessary to scale and replicate new mobility services encompassing connected infrastructure, network and interconnected mobility. Horizontal integration of parking and mobility data will allow cities to better understand mobility behaviors of citizens and tailor transportation solutions respectively. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK According to the Energy Transition Commission (ETC), business sector can play a major part in combating climate change, but only with strong government support. To accelerate the shift into electromobility and sustainable innovations, legislation needs to keep pace with technology. Regulations for innovative business models often do not exist, causing a time lag for policy response, and resulting in innovations falling short of their potential. For implementation of interconnected and multimodal transport, legislation relating to mobile ticketing, taxation, revenue sharing and data sharing is required. When it comes to electromobility adoption,Norway and UK are front-runners.The demand for EVs is strongly correlated with financial incentives.In Polandthe Act on Electromobility and Alternative Fuels proposesthat the charging of electric vehicles should not be regarded as a sale of electric energy and the licenses for the energy sale will not be required. Regulations should also take into consideration, potential uses of renewably-generated electricity to power EVs. An example of Uber shows they do not wait for legislation but rather act first and deal with the consequences later. Apart from regulatory sandbox, deployment of demonstrator projects and testing new business models is conditioned by the support from the side of proper funding and governance. Local government should be able to devote resources to small-scale pilots, like Wroclaw CityLab department created to test promising innovations, prove their usefulness, the value for the city and citizens before decision about mass deployment is taken. Outcome-oriented policies that fit into the vision of sustainable transport, may be integrated into Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans which will pursue innovative applications of new technologies, and new forms of partnerships. Sometimes cooperation may be required between partners who are not used to work together. One of the recent examples of new forms of partnerships in mobility, which had to go through the European Commission examination, was cooperation between BMW and Daimler on the new multimodal services encompassing EV charging, parking services, taxi ride-hailing, car-sharing[4]. Regarding to regulations for EV infrastructure, local authorities will play an executing role in EV chargers installations. In Poland, municipalities with at least 100.000 inhabitants, in which at least 60.000 vehicles have been registered, and having at least 400 vehicles per 1.000 inhabitants, are subject to the obligation to install charging stations.Public authority of the Lille Metropole considers three options of investments for EV charging stations installations: 1) in public spaces, 2) in Park&Ride facilities, 3) in off-street parking lots. Apart from chargers installations, the Lille Metropole ensures similar prices, services (paying card, mobile app) and interoperability. The authority examines also an effective strategy to integrate private and public stations and management of EV chargers located at large parking lots (mostly underground in the city centre) which are operated by different private operators under a delegation of public services[5]. Conclusion Enhancing urban transportation and shaping the next generation smart mobility, will require new business models supported by friendly regulatory framework. Integration of innovative solutions and technologies into the daily aspects of a city will engage taking some risk. However, there is also risk associated with taking no action and maintaining the status quo. To share the risk of innovation in a fast pacing technological environment, cooperation between stakeholders is fundamental. Integrating Smart Parking into Sustainable Mobility Action Plans complements multimodality strategy, making the approach more comprehensive. Interconnected, seamless and sustainable urban mobility needs an infrastructural link in the form of a digital, Smart Parking platform making it possible that all the Smart Mobility elements will come together satisfying urbanities’ mobility needs.

Yes, there’s a high demand for talented individuals in an increasing pool of lucrative tech jobs. But it’s becoming slightly more difficult to acquire a role in strong organizations that offer real opportunities. And there may be a couple of reasons why: non-transparent pay and policies, lack of strong company culture, horrible leadership, and most significantly, a shortage of soft skills among the talent pool. Employers are not just looking for people with the best qualifications to perform on the job. They are looking for great team players, future mentors, and inspiring leaders to join their organizations. While technical skills are extremely important to acquire a competitive job in the tech industry, it’s important to highlight the growing importance of interpersonal skills when it comes to tech hiring. Interpersonal skills, or soft skills, are behaviors a person uses to interact with others. Soft skills are what makes an individual social, engaging, and personal — the characteristics that directly affect one’s relationships with other people. And in the business world, this is what matters the most. Employers today are looking for people who will make an impact in the workplace, and nurture relationships that support strong and rich company culture. If they don’t hire the right kind of people, it can lead to reduced work quality, limited job satisfaction, and an unproductive work environment. Something that all business leaders and managers want to avoid. In order to overcome this challenge, tech recruiters often look for a combination of both technical and interpersonal skills in a candidate. Following are a variety of skills that will likely boost your chance to land a job in the tech industry: There’s no doubt that you need to have some working knowledge, if not at an expert level, at one or more of the following programming languages and frameworks if you’re seeking a job as a programmer or software engineer. Choosing a programming language and gaining experience in various frameworks is quite a difficult task. Job seekers should pick and choose a programming language to learn based on what career goals they are trying to pursue and what role they want to land. For example, if someone is interested in working as a web developer, they cant afford to neglect JavaScript. However, if someone is interested in landing a job with Apple, they have to ensure that they are well-versed in Swift (a programming language the company has been heavily using). When it comes to frameworks, Apache Spark seems to be the prevalent choice among large organizations such as Amazon, Yahoo! And Samsung. Each language takes job seekers on a different journey. It’s essential that they realize what career paths they want to pursue, and excel in a programming language and framework accordingly. DevOps is shifting the standard for enterprise IT teams, and those with a broad knowledge of and experience with the DevOps approach are in great need. While the current average salary for a DevOps engineer jumped by 4.8% over the past year, it’s expected to rise even higher for 2020. Over the last few years, the advances made in AI technology has left no choice for companies to invest more in smart technologies. So there’s really no surprise that tech professionals are in high demand that is prepared to work with them. While not every person in the tech industry needs to be an expert in AI, some knowledge or experience can definitely become a differentiating factor and increase the chances of getting hired. There are many online courses committed to enhancing and developing AI and machine learning skills, but it’s crucial that you find the right one that caters to your pre-existing skill set. Focus on developing AI-related skills that will have the biggest influence on your current role so that you’re ready for when the tide shifts! Data visualization is a process of converting large amounts of raw data and converting it into a visual context. For example, turning spreadsheets or reports into charts and graphs that can be easily understood and conceived. With an average salary of around $98,264 this skill is slowly becoming more in demand because organizations want to make more use of all of the information they own. As mentioned in our previous post, cloud-related jobs are abundant with a very low pool of talent. That’s partly because of a huge shift among companies towards the use of cloud services, and a lack of skilled workers who are knowledgeable and experienced in cloud computing services offered by AWS, Azure, and Google. While there are numerous other cloud service providers out there, these three are definitely the leaders in the space, with AWS pioneering the cloud service sector. For a detailed breakdown, check out this informative blog. Even though technical skills are of dire importance in the workplace, employers desperately need tech personnel to lead a conversation as well as they can code. Improving communication skills is key for many job seekers in the tech space to differentiate themselves from the crowd of other tech candidates, especially when competing for the best jobs. While it’s hard to make sure that communication skills stand out on an application, candidates can excel and make a statement during an interview. Need to polish your speaking skills? Check out these courses here. The term “think-outside-the-box” couldn’t be more relevant for tech personnel today. The ability to think creatively will make you an asset to any tech team because often the most optimal solutions are the least obvious. Without curiosity and creativity, it’s pretty difficult to come up with new outlooks and solutions for certain problems. Creativity as a soft skill allows job seekers in the tech industry to differentiate themselves from those who are striving to learn, and those who are actually solving problems in the workplace. Often times, when tech professionals are developing new products they fail to understand the end-user and the problem they are trying to resolve. Having empathy for customers is extremely important in today’s tech industry, as it allows engineers and developers to create better products that are well-received by customers. The tech landscape is constantly changing, so most employers aren’t really looking for someone who’s mastered a few important technologies or languages; they’re looking for someone they know can adopt regardless of what’s going on around them. Try and constantly be learning in order to keep your mind as dynamic as possible — even though maybe not everything you learn you can translate to your work, having a learning-focused mindset can pay big dividends as technologies come and go.

https://medium.com/@mgilly97/history-of-communication-tech-f48f1e60972b?source=tag_archive---------90-----------------------,History of Communication Tech.,Written by Matt Gilligan,Matt Gilligan,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Matt Gilligan Follow -- Listen Share Over time, as communication technology progresses, major shifts in society and social organization have come along with that progression. In his article “Media Evolution and Cultural Change”, Joshua Meyrowitz outlines four major eras of human progression through evolving modes of communication technology. By separating evolution into four distinct eras, Meyrowitz expands on the differences in society between these eras and how communication technologies influenced those changes.  The first era Meyrowitz outlines traditional oral and tribal cultures that existed from the emergence of humans to the development of writing technology. In this era, all information was stored in memory and transmitted orally between members of a social group or tribe. With that being the only form of communication, information and general knowledge could not be stored and shared as easily to develop a complex society. Meyrowitz explains how the modern notion of the individual was impossible to develop because people relatively held the same knowledge and cultural experience as other members of society. The next era is scribal societies where writing technology was first developed and early civilizations were developing. Primarily communication was still transmitted orally, but Meyrowitz writes the introduction of writing “segregated those who can read and write from those who cannot”. Feudal societies were developed and structured as hierarchies for the main form of social organization within the scribal era. The transmission of information through what was written was limited to only what scribes could produce in society. The next era was marked by the invention of the printing press and developments of mass communication that persisted in society. Meyerowitz explains how the easy sharing of information allowed people to form individual perspectives and the “development of larger intellectual, political, and religious” social organization that didn’t exist during the scribal era. These major changes to society were brought on by the fact that information could be copied and shared creating an environment where knowledge could grow and persist. Larger institutions were developed creating larger industries that could function with new communication technology. Finally, the last era outlined by Meyrowitz is the postmodern era marked by global electronic media and further developments in mass communication sparked by internet technology. Meyrowitz explains how technological developments through this period have allowed for shared experiences through new mediums. These developments in technology and the internet have allowed for a network of global communication that flourishes today.  Through Meyrowitz eras we see how the two biggest early shifts were sparked by the addition of writing and the printing press to society. In the early tribal era, the main storage of information and knowledge was through memory. This created a very limited social structure and although people were organized into tribes there was little difference between members of society. Meyrowitz notes how humans “naturally develop the abilities to utter and understand speech, oral societies have relatively few status distinctions, which would require different sets of social information and experience”. In this age, information is extremely limited and cannot be stored and passed on as easily solely relying on memory. With the addition of writing in the scribal era, people no longer needed to rely on memory to store information. This created drastic changes in how society would function. Power in society began to shift and social classes were becoming more distinct. As writing technology was invented, those who could use the technology to share and store more complex ideas and thoughts quickly gained advantages in society. They held the power and controlled information creating the feudal society in which people lived. Even bigger changes to society stemmed from the invention of the printing press. Once information could be copied and shared at a faster rate than ever before a newly expanded knowledge base was created. Books were invented and people began to form individual thought and vastly different social experiences. Mass communication could now thrive sparking an industrial revolution allowing major companies to thrive. Along with this came further divisions of power between institutions in society much like we see today. Party politics, social, and economic institutions create divisions of power within society. As we see these technological changes that are relatively simple inventions within the first two eras created major changes to society. When methods of communication advance and become more complex, patterns of social organization and social behavior begin to drastically change society. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*WBMkjrDETVVSnO01.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*WBMkjrDETVVSnO01.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*WBMkjrDETVVSnO01.jpg"
https://medium.com/voices-from-the-open-science-movement/how-data-commons-can-support-open-science-49009630f728?source=tag_archive---------93-----------------------,How Data Commons Can Support Open Science,Published in CAOS by Sage Bionetworks,Sage Bionetworks,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sage Bionetworks Follow CAOS by Sage Bionetworks -- Listen Share By Robert Grossman In the discussion about open science, we refer to the need for having data commons. What are data commons and why might a community develop one? I offer a brief introduction and describe how data commons can support open science. Data commons are used by projects and communities to create open resources to accelerate the rate of discovery and increase the impact of the data they host. Notice what data commons aren’t: Data commons are not designed for an individual researcher working on an isolated project to ignore FAIR principles and to dump their data to satisfy data management and data sharing requirements. More formally, data commons are software platforms that co-locate: 1) data, 2) cloud-based computing infrastructure, and 3) commonly used software applications, tools and services to create a resource for managing, analyzing and sharing data with a community. The key ways that data commons support open science include: A good example of how data commons can support open science is the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) that was launched in 2016 by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The GDC has over 2.7 PB of harmonized genomic and associated clinical data and is used by over 100,000 researchers each year. In an average month, 1–2 PB or more of data are downloaded or accessed from it. The GDC supports an open data ecosystem that includes large scale cloud-based workspaces, as well as Jupyter notebooks, RStudio notebooks, and more specialized applications that access GDC data via the GDC API. The GDC saves the research community time and effort since research groups have access to harmonized data that have been curated with respect to a common data model and run with a set of common bioinformatics pipelines. By using a centralized cloud-based infrastructure, the GDC also reduces the total cost for the cancer researchers to work with large genomics data since each research group does not need to set up and operate their own large-scale computing infrastructure. Based upon this success, a number of other communities are building their own data commons or considering it.

Why cyber criminals target humans rather than technology.",Written by Reza Mehman,Reza Mehman,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Reza Mehman Follow -- Listen Share Whenever people hear or read about cyber attacks, they imagine powerful hackers that are capable to hack the digital Fort Knox. They use state-of-the-art technology and are able to hack any kind of technology. But what most people forget is, cyber attackers target “humans” rather than “technology. The statistics states, that the initial attack vector in just 9% of all cases is “technology”. In 91% of all attacks, the vulnerability “human” is exploited. (1) Obviously exploiting people is much easier than exploiting technology. And interestingly, one of the first documented human exploit, comes from the bible, the story about Isaac and his both sons Jacob and Esau. To gain the birthright blessing, Jacob presented himself as Esau in front of his poor sight, dying father. Jacob dressed himself in Esau’s clothes and covered his arms in lamb skin so if Isaac would touch him he would think, that this is Jacob. This is basically what we call identity theft. Obviously it was sufficient to “smell” like Esau (because of his clothes) and to “feel” like Esau (because of the lamb skin). Just a quick side note from me: I’m wondering, if Esau was really that hairy ;-) Moving forward to today, the number of identity theft victims in the US rose to $16.7 M in 2017, causing damage to over $17 billion. (2) And it is not just about identity thefts. Hackers use different ways to exploit the vulnerability of humans. For example: 1) Phishing A phishing attack is an attempt by hackers to get your sensitive information such as user names, passwords, and credit card information by pretending to be a trustworthy source. Usually this is done through emails that look “official”. And you probably already received these kind of phishing emails: 2) Ransomware The purpose of ransomware is usually to lock you out of your computer and to encrypt your files. The hackers then demand a ransom in order to get your files back. 3) Spyware Spyware enables a hacker to obtain information about you and your computer by transmitting data from your hard drive without your knowledge. 4) Malware Malware is hostile or intrusive software that can damage your computer. Malware can include computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, etc. And why is these kind of cyber crime still working? Simple answer, because: Humans trust, even if they shouldn’t. You don’t believe me? On a very interesting presentation in Munich I made a test with the audience. You see: humans trust, even if they shouldn’t. So there might be the question now, how can technology help, to minimize the human vulnerability? Cybersecurity experts are working hard to find a solution. One solution is e.g. to use Machine Learning capabilities, to detect anomalies in the user behaviour. A very nice Machine Learning use case around Online Banking looks like this. The ML model can tell from the user’s “typing speed” whether the user himself types in the payment details or whether his online banking account has been hacked and a hacker is typing with much higher speed the banking details in. It is very likely that a hacker is able to use the computer keyboard faster than a typical private end user and thus anomalies can be detected during operation. As you can see, the possibilities with machine learning are just arising. I wrote an article to grasp this topic: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/game-changer-machine-learning-reza-mehman/ To minimize your own attack surface or just to be less vulnerable, you can follow these recommendations: 1) Be picky with usage of software Question the usage of new computer programs or smartphone apps, links, websites, etc. You probably have sensitive files on your computer or smartphone, think really hard about which risk you want to expose it to. 2) Take care of basic protection Use up-to-date antivirus software, choose good passwords and change them on regular basis. And please, do not use 123456! As most of the people do, like you can see here: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47974583 3) Be a little “paranoid” Question the sender of an email, question the email’s attachment. Call the person who wrote you to be sure, that he really sent out this attachment. One additional call is way better than one additional security incident. Exploiting people is much easier than exploiting technology. The exploits are usually done via phishing attacks, ransomware, spyware or malware. This is possible because people trust, even if they shouldn’t. But you’re still capable of defending yourself. Be picky, when it comes to new apps, take care of basic protection like antivirus software and be a little paranoid, when receiving attachments via e.g. emails.

https://medium.com/@foodfinderblog/10-values-of-a-new-age-nonprofit-f947dc8857db?source=tag_archive---------115-----------------------,10 Values of a New-Age Nonprofit,Written by Jack from FoodFinder,Jack from FoodFinder,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Jack from FoodFinder Follow -- Listen Share When you think of a nonprofit, what’s the first thing that comes to mind? Is it your local volunteer program or community center? Or do you think of giants like the American Cancer Society or Salvation Army? Well, somewhere in between those two ends of the spectrum lies a new wave of social enterprises. These nonprofits are not decades old and have a new set of ideals. Bureaucracy? Avoided at all costs. Good intentions? Must translate to actually respectful interactions with those we serve. Technology? Everything. Enter FoodFinder in this new wave. As a website and mobile app, we don’t even have a physical location at all. We do, however, aim to achieve strides in the fight against hunger that were never possible before. Our platform is creating the first national database of every food pantry in America so that food insecure families can search for programs within walking distance to get free food. That’s what we do. This article is about why we do it. These 10 values are why we connect people looking for help with the places that offer it. And as a 20-year-old founder, I proudly believe them to be the values that urge me and countless others my age forward to solve the world’s problems. #1: Massive Problems Need Massive Solutions Monumental change doesn’t happen overnight. More importantly, it doesn’t happen by aiming small. Helping others is always worthwhile, but we’re not here to just feed families. We’re here to move the needle. We’re not here to just fight hunger. We’re here to win the fight against hunger. We’re not here to be satisfied with yesterday’s progress. We’re here to noticeably and transformatively improve the system so that entire communities are better off as a result. Massive problems need massive solutions, so let’s provide one. #2: Gratitude is Wonderful and Worth Expressing The mindset behind gratitude is as important as the expression of that sentiment. We’ve all said “thank you” thousands of times in our lives. Yet truly being thankful for something or someone is a magical state of mind. From the worker’s perspective, the most meaningful thanks received are the times when we didn’t expect to be thanked. It is wonderfully fulfilling to be noticed and appreciated. And the blessing behind gratitude is that it benefits both the giver and the recipient. Appreciating the people behind good deeds, strangers and friends alike, demonstrates that we recognize how inherently valuable they really are. #3: Service is NOT Saviorism It has never and will never be our place to view the families we serve as helpless victims waiting for a hero. It has never and will never be our place to believe we automatically have the right answer for the groups we cater to. It has never and will never be our place to see ourselves as the focus of what we do. We are no one’s savior. We purely aim to be of service. Our minds crave simplicity in a chaotic, messy world. That’s why it’s so tempting to reduce a person to one element of their identity. We’re not in the business of helping lazy caricatures of what are in reality horrible, deeply-seated macro-societal forces. We are here to work alongside human beings with backgrounds and dreams as diverse as the country we live in. Respecting those histories and hopes is a must. #4: We Can Always Be Better We need to be better than we were before. It’s a slippery slope trying to reconcile appreciation for what we have with ambition for what’s possible. However, if we’ve been doing the same thing the same way for a while, a better way might have emerged in the midst of our comfort. We might have missed that better way from the start. It’s possible there doesn’t seem to even be a way forward at all. But we’ll find a way. The key is to keep trying. Stay on the search, because that time invested today could make a huge difference in the long run. #5: Hope Must Triumph Over Cynicism Becoming jaded is a genuine concern for those involved in impact work. A colossal amount of time and effort can end up with the appearance of not much changing. In this instance, hope is not based on wishful thinking but on mindful planning. The anticipation of progress made tomorrow starts today. It will undoubtedly be a battle to avoid negativity at times. Should this be the case, the other Branches regarding gratitude and mutual encouragement are excellent preventive measures. Caring for yourself and cherishing your optimism perpetually translate to an even better ability to care for others in the future. #6: Remember the Faith Placed in Us By our users. By our donors. By each other. The immediacy of the next project is tough to see past, but every hour spent working is time we can repay and reward the faith of those who’ve bestowed it upon us. If we are grateful for those who rely on us and support us, then let’s put it into action. We interact with extraordinary people from all walks of life because of our mission. The least we can do is honor them and exceed their expectations. Many (if not most) people can’t say they feel a deeper bond to their work. It’s a pleasure and a privilege to help those in need, so a healthy dose of joy can’t hurt in remembering, repaying, and rewarding our constituents and comrades. #7: Face the Urgency of Now “The Urgency of Now” is a phrase Dr. King used during his March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Even though the context may vary, there’s a profound realization behind those words. The Urgency of Now internalizes the fact that social and economic suffering which occurs day in and day out becomes routine. Normalized. But we can never, ever let that be a crutch for our inaction. Once that “routine” suffering passes, it’s in the past. It can no longer be prevented. It has irrevocably occurred. Every night that a child goes to sleep hungry can’t be reversed after the fact. Therefore, we face the fierce Urgency of Now. It is yet another tall task to balance immediate problems with systematic causes. The need for action with the need for reflection. The short-term with the long-term. We have to try. #8: Encourage Each Other We’re going to encourage each other. Plain and simple. There’s a camaraderie present when we’re in the trenches together. When we treat each other like family. Sure, every company on the planet says that they’re a family. Well, not every family is the greatest. For us, we’re trying to conquer hunger. We can’t afford to be the family that points fingers when something goes wrong. Not to mention that something always goes wrong. When we stand together, lock arms, and push onward, our brotherhood and our sisterhood can give us more power than we’d ever have on our own. We can be the family that faces the truth head-on and weathers the storm, and it all starts by having faith in one another. There is incredible beauty and humanity in shared perseverance. #9: Care Enough to Go Beyond Never forget that we operate in an outdated, resource-constrained landscape where being given the runaround is typical. Searching for social services is exhausting and embarrassing. If people repeatedly cry on the phone talking to us because we listen and sincerely care about them, you then understand how heart-shatteringly low of a bar the current system has set. So how do we respond? What does our organization have the chance to be? A welcome relief. A definitive answer. Someone who actually cares. It’s not enough to make our users feel better. We’re here to help them sleep easier. We know where the bar has been set. Now it’s time to go far beyond it. #10: Respond with “Just You Wait” Whenever someone is gracious enough to feature or recognize our work, respond with this. “Just you wait.” This is just the start. For the same reason why hope must triumph in our work, we should all ponder what lies in the future and smile with excitement. Regardless of what we did yesterday, we have the opportunity to work towards a horizon that is brighter than the one before. We have the ability to work towards a gentler future, one where family ever has to worry about putting food on the table. The ultimate faith is the faith in your ability to change the world. We may have started long ago. For all the footsteps we’ve left behind in the sand, this is only the beginning. Just you wait. -- -- Home to FoodFinder's official blog.

https://medium.com/@IITDesign/building-a-new-foundation-adapting-bauhaus-pedagogy-for-the-future-of-design-a59e524e6740?source=tag_archive---------32-----------------------,Building a New Foundation: Adapting Bauhaus Pedagogy for the Future of Design,Written by Institute of Design (ID) at Illinois Tech,Institute of Design (ID) at Illinois Tech,No Author URL,N/A,9 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Institute of Design (ID) at Illinois Tech Follow -- Listen Share By M. Todd Cooke (MDes + MBA 2020) and Jason Romano (MDes 2020) The Institute of Design, colloquially known as “ID,” is a child of the Bauhaus: its rebellious teenager. As the second-generation instantiation of the German art school, with the most direct lineage, ID continues to wrestle with its Bauhaus heritage. The original Bauhaus has been both lionized and criticized for its outsized and normative influence on the discipline called design. To the dismay of architect Dong-Ping Wong, “The Bauhaus’s role in commodifying design has really helped pigeonhole what most people understand “design” to be,” with Jony Ive’s universal and unobtrusive iPhone aesthetic becoming its apotheosis. On its surface, the Institute of Design has rebelled against this notion, attracting students who engage design with an aim to solve the proverbial “wicked” problems of the world today. Unlike others who primarily engage the Bauhaus as a movement, a style, or a philosophy, the Institute of Design (ID) probes its legacy as an academic institution. The importance of this perspective is emphasized by Barry Bergdoll, curator of the Department of Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art, who reminds those willing to listen that “the Bauhaus was a school. It wasn’t a movement. It wasn’t a style. It was a school.” In spite of being, perhaps, the only cultural institution privileged with this unique perspective of the Bauhaus, ID has been reluctant to succumb to nostalgia as it tries to chart a path to the future. Yet as the centennial of the most famous European art school dawns upon us, ID has been forced to look back and engage its legacy. Engaging the scholastic legacy of the Bauhaus is no easy task; teachers and administrators alike must weigh the pros and cons of which traditions to maintain and which to leave behind in the wake of the digital era. Against the backdrop of what’s been called the third industrial revolution, the dilemma faced by modern pedagogues is similar to that of the original Bauhaus, who saw mechanization supplanting the work of the craftsman and the engineer taking the place of the artist in forging the future. Digitization is the new industrialization and, given the new landscape, Denis Weil, dean of the Institute of Design, sees the pendulum of design swinging back toward experimentation. Since he came on board two years ago, Weil has challenged the faculty to reconsider the existing course structure towards that end. “Whenever you have new technology,” Weil explains, “you need to experiment to figure out what the best way forward is.” If Bauhaus explored novel materials, such as steel and glass, “data is one of our new materials,” Weil says. In carrying forward the pedagogy of the Bauhaus into the modern age, Weil began with Foundation, the preliminary course of fundamentals training on topics ranging from form — what the German Bauhaus termed gestalt — to color, visual hierarchy, nature studies, and optics. As recounted by the Bauhaus Archive: At the start of their studies, they received a year of basic training in the so-called preliminary course, in which they were able to experiment with colour, shape and materials with no specific goals. Depending on their individual suitability, this was followed by practical work in the workshops and accompanying disciplines. The students entered the workshops as ‘apprentices’ and sat for their ‘apprenticeship’ exams within a given time period. [Emphasis added.] Experimentation was encouraged as a means of making sense of change. The Bauhaus needed to engage technologies and materials for which society lacked both a vocabulary and a methodology. On that front, little has changed today. According to Weil, it has been through Foundation that ID has primarily engaged its Bauhaus legacy, having remained a part of the school’s pedagogical approach for the entirety of its 80-year existence. However, Weil — himself a product of the Foundation program — has moved Foundation from a peripheral position to one of centrality, a position formerly occupied by Gropius’ “building,” bau in German [Figure 1 & Figure 2]. At ID, Foundation is the hub of the new wheel. This represents an important decision in realizing the Bauhaus’s vision of orienting design toward society and the common good. ID’s new curricular subsections include concentrations like insight development, human advocacy, prototyping, critique & evaluation, systems thinking, and leadership & mediation [Figure 2], all of which radiate outward, not inward, toward the world at large. Rather than promising technical mastery, these courses are designed to cultivate the skill sets required to engage multiple stakeholders. At the turn of the century, Bauhaus designers primarily concerned themselves with domestic space, an environment over which they could exert significant control. The school no longer aspires to that narrow view. In today’s hyper-connected society, designers have more impact as collaborators than as sole decision-makers. In the generative design workshop, led by ID studio instructor Zach Pino, many design ‘decisions’ are arrived at through computational mediation — algorithms, sensors, and code — while associate professor Carlos Teixeira’s service systems workshop engages community members in developing solutions to industrial brownfield sites. The shift from ‘designer as decision maker’ to ‘designer as facilitator’ arguably began with Jay Doblin. Doblin, who needs little in the way of introduction in the halls of ID, served as director during the school’s most tumultuous period and set ID on the course it continues today. Endeavoring to solve systemic problems in the private and social space, Doblin took little in the way of pedagogical inspiration from his predecessor, the school’s Bauhaus founder László Moholy-Nagy, by shifting the focus toward professional practice. Although Doblin himself was a product designer, today the school can, at times, appear perplexingly bereft of material. At first appraisal, contrasting the image of the excessively generative Bauhaus with the bare, all-white interior of ID’s new Kaplan Institute can come as a shock. “The Bauhaus made stuff,” studio professor Martin Thaler, who heads the school’s product design curriculum, explains. “And for a long time the arc of the Institute of Design was away from making anything. That was my role, to keep that part of the institution alive.” A possible rationale for the abrupt shift is that many of today’s systemic problems stem from a surplus rather than a dearth of consumer goods. “We can make anything,” adds Jeff Mau, who teaches an introductory survey course on design history and theory. “So the question now is what do we make?” Yet Mau agrees with Thaler — in spite of the ethical shortcomings of turn-of-the-century production practices, material exploration rises to significant value in the digital age. If there’s one common methodology that carries the Bauhaus legacy through to the present day, it’s the diagram. According to civic architect Elizabeth Timme, “as the Bauhaus used it, [the diagram] was a tool to investigate something and also was a way to engage a larger audience about design.” If the Bauhaus birthed the diagram as a communication tool, then Doblin turned it into a discipline entirely unto itself. Doblin sought to develop a methodology through which it was possible “to marry design processes to design problems.” The diagram was his solution, engaging simultaneously the intermediate flow of information and its aggregate output. To invoke Walter Gropius’ language, the diagram became a “new way of seeing and understanding the composite character” of the whole. If diagrams and methodologies are a means to reframe problems, analyze information, and synthesize solutions, they can still be misused or used unnecessarily to signal ‘rigorous design.’ This is a common critique of the ‘design thinking’ principles pioneered at ID and brought into mainstream business lexicon by IDEO. A true design process, however, must practice self-critique and seek new methods when necessary. Clinical professor Tomoko Ichikawa, who teaches communication and information design in the tradition of Doblin, recalls an experience watching students incorrectly apply the 5E framework, a consumer journey map, to a social innovation situation: Designers are problem solvers. So if you get to a place where the methods that you’re using are not going to be applicable, what do you do? You have to modify the method. We have to come up with our own. And I think if you get too comfortable relying on frameworks and methods, that’s a problem. The dissolution of the Bauhaus in 1933 threw many of its failings into sharp relief, one of which was its failure to encourage and support a diversity of voices and ideas. “The idea of wanting to bring the disciplines together was great,” states contemporary designer Marlene Barnett, “but then the idea of bringing all the voices and people together didn’t happen.” Her sentiments are corroborated by historical record. The Bauhaus masters were almost all male, and women were restricted to studying traditional handicrafts, namely weaving. While they opposed the Nazis, the school was similarly plagued by anti-semitism. This is where Dale Fahnstrom (director of ID, 1982–1986) and Patrick Whitney (dean, 1987–2016), took a bold step in correcting and realizing the Bauhaus’s original vision. If the Bauhaus engendered a close-minded groupthink in its pursuit of aesthetic “mastery,” Whitney, in particular, attempted to open the school to a plurality of perspectives. He closed the school’s undergraduate department in the early 1990s. This made ID the only graduate-only design school in the US and shifted the balance of its student body to accommodate 50 percent non-designers as well as 50 percent international students. According to Ichikawa, “the idea [was] that you can bring in multiple perspectives to have a much broader conversation around design and design solutions. As [Patrick] became the dean, he had very specific metrics in terms of what kind of community he wanted.” Another turning point for ID is currently underway as the curriculum prepares to re-embrace experimentation, and strengthen connections to current and emerging design practices. ID has returned to IIT’s Mies campus after 22 years in downtown Chicago, softening its image as an industry-focused professional school and hoping to stimulate engagement with other disciplines at the university. The notion of legacy arises again, as the school considers welcoming new voices from outside its immediate sphere of influence, former ID grads and its professional corollary, Doblin-Deloitte (the innovation consulting firm founded by the school’s former dean). The strength of a design education undoubtedly lies in doing. For Matt Mayfield, ID’s associate dean, the emphasis on making remains core to the DNA of the school: “[ID’s curriculum] follows a constructivist pedagogy, you learn by doing.” Walter Gropius instilled this philosophy in 1919, calling for a dissolution of the distinction between artisan and artist: “The ultimate goal of all art is building! Architects, painters and sculptors must learn a new way of seeing and understanding the composite character of the building, both as a totality and in terms of its parts.” In 2019, 100 years since the founding of the small German arts school in Weimar, the steam engine has been replaced by Moore’s Law, and hyper-customization is seen as the modern-day foible to the malaise brought on by mass production. Where the Bauhaus sought harmony between the artist and the craftsman, today we seek harmony between data and the individual. The technological competency of the engineer, which once infringed on the domain of the artist, has been replaced by the Silicon Valley coder, whose decisions can impact millions in distant parts of the world. ‘Design thinking,’ at once maligned and misunderstood, has been seized on with unbridled enthusiasm from the corporate and consulting world, just as titans of American industry once chomped at the bit to produce Bauhaus-styled goods. But as a pedagogical institution, caught between centuries, ID’s ultimate goal, hopefully, perhaps foolishly, remains the same as when Laszlo Moholy-Nagy founded the school in 1937: forging a “New Vision,” a new way of seeing. In 2019, we at Illinois Tech celebrate the centenary of the founding of the Bauhaus, together with institutions worldwide. In the spirit of this celebration and IIT Institute of Design’s (ID’s) heritage as the New Bauhaus, student group mediaID produced a Bauhaus newsletter. A collection written, photographed, designed, and curated by students at ID and Illinois Tech, in the newsletter students reflect on the influence of the Bauhaus, examining its relevance and impact today while also looking toward the future. This project was sponsored by Chicago’s Goethe-Institut. ID students also collaborated with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where students created a companion newsletter.

Regardless, it’s safe to say that you’re in the minority if you don’t own an Apple product. My thought explorations recently have led me to examine the art of signaling, which is what we project out to others without speaking. People signal things about themselves with every choice they make or don’t make. When someone wears a Nike sweater they are signaling that they can afford name brand apparel, are (or would like to be) athletic and trendy. I am willing to bet money on the fact that, if you didn’t Google it prior to reading this piece, you have no idea and had never even really thought about why Apple is called Apple or why there is a bite missing from the logo. Every decision we make, whether we are conscious of it or not, communicates some information about us to other people. That’s why it’s important to send the right signals- you never get a second chance to make a first impression. -- -- Venture Studio expert. Creator capitalist. Lover of innovation.

https://medium.com/@TechNerdStephen/why-google-doesnt-need-to-sell-a-lot-of-pixel-smartphones-82aaeaa0125?source=tag_archive---------141-----------------------,Why Google Doesn’t Need to Sell a Lot of Pixel Smartphones,Written by Stephen Perkins,Stephen Perkins,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Stephen Perkins Follow -- Listen Share We’ve all seen the headlines recently with articles that say something like “Google Pixel 3 Smartphone Sales Are Down, and They Are Failing Hard.” Here’s the real scoop: Google isn’t trying to beat anyone at anything — they willingly provide smartphone manufacturers with so much free range via AOSP so they can build their own versions of Android. They also supply system level APIs so the manufacturers can implement special hardware features into their customized versions of Android. The fact is, Google wants these manufacturers to go wild with the tools they provide them with — they want to see what cool things these companies can cook up. They also want to see them succeed and continue to push the industry in the right direction. Since Google is the leader of Android; none of the other Android smartphone markets would exist without them. Your Samsung’s, LG’s, Motorola’s, OnePlus’s, Huawei’s, Oppo’s, and Xiaomi’s? These smartphone lines would probably cease to exist without Google offering Android as an open source ecosystem. At the very least, things would likely be very messy without Android. You think we have an issue with fragmented system updates now? Imagine if every smartphone manufacturer had their own proprietary OS with its own exclusive app store that only worked on their specific devices. We’d have multiple different companies that would each operate under a separate closed source ecosystem, which is not suitable for the general consumer market — the power of choice is always a desirable thing to have. Imagine having a dozen smartphone companies that all work the same way Apple does with its business; it would be a huge mess. Apps would be a disaster because a developer would have to manage their app across a dozen entirely different platforms, which means quality will go down while bugs and errors would be plenty. This, of course, drives up costs even more, which means even less of a reason to produce high-quality work. Google puts out the Pixel smartphone line to show what can be done on the software side of things using the very same hardware the other Android manufacturers have access to. They must lead by example to show off new versions of Android, which then gives a baseline for the rest of the manufacturers to follow suit. The fact that the single camera system on the Pixel smartphones has been outpacing multiple camera phones in recent years is evidence enough about their software strengths. Google has already made a significant impact with the Pixel smartphone line in just a few short years, which is impressive — they haven’t been a hardware company for long either. Everyone and their mother knows what kind of photos Google’s camera can produce with it’s AI and machine learning algorithms, which is why you see Pixel camera app ports for just about every new device out now. It can take any camera system and potentially improve upon it by quite a large margin in some cases. To say that the Pixel smartphones have “failed” is an irresponsible and overly exaggerated mess. Google and the Pixel smartphone line carry a substantial influence over the Android ecosystem as a whole — it goes far beyond the camera experience. The internet likes to twist things, transform nothing topics into more than they are, and then turn them into a negative stigma with false stories and headlines to generate views. The real news is that Android has about 72 percent global market share at last check in Q4 2018, and is thriving more than ever. Without Google’s venture into the world of mobile, we’d be living in a different world of smartphones that probably would consist of iOS as the primary choice. Not a bad thing, but not having a diverse group of device options across the world would seem a bit… gray. So Google is doing us all a favor, both consumer and smartphone manufacturer alike. They give manufacturers a platform to help create their own visions, which then allows consumers to have the freedom of choice. So, no, Pixel smartphones aren’t “losing” anything by comparison of sheer hardware sales — that’s not the point of all this, it never was. Back when Google was still participating with Nexus partners, it was never about the total number of hardware sales either. It was about what can be done when you combine a solid hardware experience with great software features — same as it is today with the Pixel line. When Google’s Pixel 4 smartphone comes out later this year, we’ll repeat history once again with the impressive new camera system, nice new Android Q update, and many other Pixel related AI features that make it a leader in the industry. I can almost guarantee that we will see plenty of headlines similar to “The Pixel 4 Is the Best Android Smartphone of 2019; Here’s Why.” It happens year in and year out with the online community — they like to blindly bash something beforehand until they try it for themselves and realize they were wrong. Internet logic, right? One thing I can tell you though, Google knows what they’re doing after decades of experience under their belt — trust me. We should all start thanking Google for their contributions to the tech world — heck, they like to work on solving a lot of real-world problems that no one else is bothering to tackle. Without Google, there would be a lot of great apps, services, and platforms missing from our lives — more than most of us are willing to admit I’m sure. Just email Google and tell them “Thank you for making technology a part of our daily lives for so many years now.” That’s all you need to say — they’ll know what you mean. -- -- An expert in technology with a passion for writing.

https://medium.com/@timesblockchain/bitcoin-average-daily-trading-volume-reaches-new-high-since-2018-a0dd1578299f?source=tag_archive---------90-----------------------,Bitcoin Average Daily Trading Volume Reaches New High Since 2018,Written by Blockchain Times,Blockchain Times,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Blockchain Times Follow -- Listen Share Average daily trading volume of the world’s largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin has reached its fresh highs since April, 2018. Independent crypto data researcher Kevin Rooke brought the community’s attention to bitcoin volume via his Saturday tweet. The analyst revealed that traders, in March, changed hands for/to the cryptocurrency to the extent of approx $10 billion. In comparison, those numbers were as low as $6.25 billion in November 2018, the month in which bitcoin price plunged 35 percent owing to the Bitcoin Cash hard fork fiasco. In retrospective, the early 2018 drop in the cryptocurrency market didn’t just wipe off valuations but traders as well. Following the crash, lesser investors were entering the crypto market, including bitcoin. That was visible in the lower trading volumes between June 2018 and October 2018. Between that period, bitcoin managed to secure a stable support level near $6,000, even though the price formed lower highs on each bounce back action. In November 2018, Bitcoin broke the $6,000-support and eventually established a new bottom near $3,100 in December 2018. The downside price action erred potential investors, indeed. Between November 2018 and January 2019, the average bitcoin trading volume was almost the same, showing poor traders’ presence in the market. However, in February, the numbers jumped to near $7 billion. And in March, they surpassed even the February’s impressive recovery. “Bitcoin’s daily exchange volume is booming,” noted Rooke. “Volume has increased [approximately] 150 percent in the last five months. Average daily volume hasn’t been this high since January 2018. Only 9 days in the last [twelve] months had $10 billion-plus in volume — five of those days have been in March 2019.” Volumes do not specifically signify a market’s bullish or bearish bias. But they do behave as indicators to confirm investors’ presence. Bitcoin has been a thinly-traded market despite its long-term bullish potentials. The 2018 crash didn’t do it any good. Negative media reports, followed by the world’s leading economists’ dismissive views, didn’t help to revive the bitcoin trading sentiment for most of the year. As a result, the cryptocurrency’s volume remained lower than it used to be. However, since December 2018, bitcoin has attempted to fight its way back to the bullish zone. The digital asset’s rate against the US dollar recovered 18.23-percent since its so-called bottom formation at $3,100, according to data available at OnChainFx.com. Interestingly, the rise in bitcoin’s daily trading volume happened at the same time. That explained that more investors came inside the bitcoin market when it showed signs of recovery in January, which ultimately led to a volume surge in February and March. Nevertheless, bitcoin exchanges continue to receive criticism for allegedly inflating their trading volumes artificially. A report published by Blockchain Transparency Institute revealed that most of bitcoin’s reported volume of CoinMarketCap.com was 99 percent fake. “Over 80% of the CMC top 25 BTC pairs volume is wash traded,” the institute wrote. “These exchanges continue to use these strategies as a business model to steal money from aspiring token projects.” If this is true, then it could pose a massive challenge for bulls to prove bitcoin’s long term bullish perspectives. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*Wd40sCrr_SHtciUXM9Ak0Q.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*Wd40sCrr_SHtciUXM9Ak0Q.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*Wd40sCrr_SHtciUXM9Ak0Q.png"
https://medium.com/drep-family/darwin-the-evolutional-origin-drep-test-network-officially-open-source-cc8d2cdf0a44?source=tag_archive---------86-----------------------,"Darwin, The Evolutional Origin | DREP Test Network Officially Open Source",Reach us on social channels,DREP Foundation,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in DREP Foundation Follow DREP family -- Listen Share At 20:00 (GMT+8) on the evening of December 28, 2018, DREP Testnet 1.0 Darwin was launched, and we announced the important performance parameters, technical breakthroughs and application fields of the Testnet 1.0. Today DREP·Darwin will be officially open source, and the technical features and its development goals of DREP Chain can be summarized as follows: | High scalability but more than Transaction per Second (TPS) — our goal is to make scalability no longer a bottleneck limiting the commercial adoption; | Humanized but more than development flexibility and privacy protection — our goal is to deliver a frictionless, user-friendly blockchain service to B-end or C-end; | Business-oriented but more than DAPPs and enterprise services, our goal is to connect all reputation data in silos on the Internet instead of simply replicating the Internet itself. DREP has completed most of the code in the Testnet 1.0 Darwin, and subsequent functions are under development. For the existing code, there will be stricter specifications on security and code norms. DREP Dev team continues to improve code efficiency, and strives to make DREP ready for more open source content so as to add value to the community. We will gradually open source the code in the following sequence and deliver the promises to the DREP users: Dec. 2018: Launched DREP Testnet 1.0 Darwin Jan. 2019: Open sourced Reputation Protocol source code and client-end source code March 2019: Open source Smart Pipeline source code April 2019: Open source the infrastructure source code For more following development and open source progress, please pay attention to our latest information. 1- DREP Decentralized ID and Data Privacy Protection 2- Smart Contract Goes Hand in Hand with DREP Smart Pipeline 3- Characteristic Reputation Protocol 4- Highly Adaptable Cross-chain Protocol 5- Performance-oriented Underlying Performance and Compatibility The overall architecture is as follows: 1- DREP Decentralized ID and Data Privacy Protection In the DREP ecosystem, each user has a main account and several sub-accounts. With DREP ID as a link, the reputation data and assets across different applications or platforms are connected to form a complete user reputation profiling. In the process of generating a sub-account using the main account, DREP uses the HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code) algorithm. Its security lies in: | Main key control: The private key that a user generates and obtains for the sub-chain account needs to match with the private key, the authentication code and the sub-chain ID of the corresponding main account at the same time, thus greatly ensuring the security of the private key of the sub-chain account. | One direction: Under the asymmetric encryption protection, regardless of the main chain or sub chain, the accounts on each chain cannot be reversely related, which completely guarantees the anonymity of information on the user's info on-chain. In addition, methods including secure multi-party computing, ring signatures and other means are applied to protect user information and minimize the risk of data abuse and leakage. Merchants or other third parties need to request authorization for user data in the context of data desensitization. Users can get profits from it, and third parties can significantly reduce the cost of data collection and KYC to achieve a win-win situation. 2- Smart Contract Goes Hand in Hand with Creative Smart Pipeline The infrastructure layer of DREP Chain supports both the common forms of EVM and WASM. Apart from Smart Contracts, DREP creatively proposes a concept — Smart Pipeline that can greatly expand data processing capabilities and functional adaptability. Because the DREP system needs to apply different reputation algorithms to different applications, it is highly customizable. In order to reduce the threshold for developers to use, DREP creates a Smart Pipeline at the key points of block execution, and can execute each sub-chain custom code through Smart Pipeline without incurring high gas costs. This technology is ahead of all the existing blockchains out there and supports parallel development of each sub-chain development team. What it differs from Smart Contract: | Automated execution: Smart Contract require users to perform transactions manually, and Smart Pipeline can automatically be executed under specific conditions. | 0 consumption: Smart Contract needs to consume gas while Smart Pipe does not need to consume gas. | Decentralization: Smart Contract is initiated by a single user to perform while Smart Pipeline is automatically executed by each node at the corresponding point in time. Now, by inserting a WASM instruction at the Smart Pipeline entry, the blockchain can execute the relevant code in the appropriate location. Through WASM, it is compatible with various languages to develop various algorithms such as reputation algorithms. 3- Characteristic Reputation Protocol The Reputation System integrates DREP’s research in many systems, such as cross-chain and DID (Decentralized Digital ID). Companies in all industries face these pain points: | How to improve customer/user loyalty; | How to make a truly motivated membership system; | How to access online credit data, obtain accurate user profiling and high-quality users. At present, the reputation-based blockchain project is either narrow in scope and difficult to form an ecological environment, or lacks actual intergration with business scenarios and cannot contribute to the real economy. The DREP Reputation Protocol is born to solve these problems. The Reputation System includes general Reputation Protocol, Smart Pipeline interface, reputation on-chain and settlement, reputation reward acquisition and other elements, which constitute a complete ecological closed loop. This has allowed DREP ID to link the user’s behavior with reputation, conduct comprehensive multi-site reputation evaluation and realize the real-time settlement of reputation changes. The general Reputation Protocol is the most important guarantee to develop an ecosystem that forms a truly valuable reputation. It has the following characteristics: 1. Convert key data of different fields of business into a standardized reputation value, record reputation changes on the blockchain according to user behavior, and achieve a reputation chain that cannot be tampered with. 2. Break existing data barriers and conduct cross-chaining of user behavior to form real-time synchronization of users’ reputation data. 3. Concentrate the user reputation of different platforms in the user’s DREP ID to form a complete user reputation profiling. Reputation Settlement is conducted through the Smart Pipeline technology. It helps users to calculate their current reputation and the historical cumulative reputation. Long-term inactivity by the user will result in a lower value. What can it do? 1. The Reputation Settlement system can swiftly reflect if the user is active or not, motivating users to continue to use the merchant platform and improve user retention. 2. The system provides a convenient function interface. The platform can reasonably select a settlement mechanism for its own business characteristics, so that the total reputation matches the user characteristics and platform business scenarios. 3. Merchants can analyze the multi-faceted activity of users with the total reputation evaluation, understand different aspects of users, and conduct more effective and targeted marketing. Reputation reward is the final step in the closed loop. It helps with more precise reward distribution on applications and better motivates users’ positive behavior. 1. Diversify the rewards and discounts according to the user’s reputation profiling across different platforms; 2. Create reputation profile and digital names for users to leverage and gain more weights and benefits when they use products and services across different platforms; 3. Reputation is tied to the DID, creating an irreplaceable digital identity card. 4- Highly Adaptable Cross-chain Protocol In order to break the data isolation, DREP adopts the isomorphic cross-chain and heterogeneous cross-chain methods based on the existing cross-chain technology. Isomorphic cross-chain: DREP main chain and sub-chain are connected to each other through lightweight isomorphic cross-chain protocol, users can instantly see the state changes between different cross-chain platforms through the wallet. Heterogeneous cross-chain: Distributed private key control technology can link the traditional platforms or applications on other chains to the DREP ecosystem and achieve a secure heterogeneous cross-chain, extending the application scope of the reputation agreement to multiple platforms. DREP’s cross-chain protocol breaks through the cross-chain mindset of asset transfer, and synchronizes and migrates important data such as reputation. 5- Performance-oriented Underlying Performance and Compatibility The DREP Chain adopts the main chain-subchain system, which improves the scalability and enhances the efficiency of the bottom layer of the blockchain without affecting security. In our Testnet 1.0 TPS competition, the TPS peak reached 12689, which is enough to prove the reliable infrastructure support for large transaction volumes. DREP effectively optimizes data layer storage to ensure high performance under high TPS, not just a fancy number. The main chain and the sub-chain can independently handle different transactions in different scenarios, allow multiple consensus mechanisms to coexist with different data storage, improve concurrency performance, and provide compatibility support for access in different scenarios. On top of this, the sub-chain customization can be combined with the platform to minimize the access threshold. DREP will eventually build a decentralised system of reputation digital IDs: | Integrate cross-chain and cross-domain protocols and achieve connection on DREP wallet | Protect user privacy on applications and achieve data soverigh — Give back data right to data owners | Portray comprehensive user reputation profiling for businesses and reduce communication costs | Connect user’s online reputation identity and create their own decentralized digital ID profile To this end, we will move forward and continue to iteratively update. ABOUT DREP Foundation DREP Foundation is devoted to building a performance-oriented technology infrastructure supporting high transaction capacity for an ecosystem generating valuable reputation data. Focusing on two industry pain points: lack of user adoption and low transaction throughput, DREP Foundation aims to provide highly scalable, modular blockchain architecture for deployment of a reputation protocol that any types of platforms can use. DREP envisions a global plan to empower a wide array of platforms to have tokenized reputation ecosystem deployed on top of DREP Chain, which is secure, scalable and reputation data supportive.

Follow GFDS Blog -- Share Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are at work again! In this article, we will talk about a highly attention-grabbing artificial intelligence application known as Deepfake technology, which has been prominent in recent times. Envisioned to elevate the entertainment industry, especially the cinema sector, this technology seems to make previously impossible applications possible. Get ready to encounter both eerie and mind-boggling aspects of this technology. The concept of Deepfake, invented in 2017, is a technique based on artificial intelligence for synthesizing human images. It utilizes a machine learning technique known as a generative adversarial network to merge and superimpose existing images and videos onto source images or videos. As we can foresee from here, it is now possible to realistically place any face on any video. Detecting the authenticity of these videos or productions is also extremely challenging. Therefore, we are faced with a technology that is both mind-boggling and raises questions in our minds. We have witnessed the most striking applications of this technology in video montages of famous faces like Obama, Putin, and Tom Cruise. These videos reached millions of people, and perhaps, if these videos were not shared with the Deepfake label, we would never have been able to discern their falseness. Now, let’s examine some striking examples that introduced the whole world to Deepfake technology: Artificial intelligence technology is evolving day by day, causing skepticism in every application: “How do they do this? How does this technology work?” Here is the answer to this question: Deepfake technology, with its incredible applications, also signals some danger signs. People are concerned about the negative consequences this technology may have when used maliciously. Users who can now use this artificial intelligence technology can montage any face onto any video they desire. This foresight particularly poses a threat to politicians and celebrities. As you can see, Obama is portrayed as saying things he never actually said, all through the use of Deepfake technology. Similarly, many politicians like Putin and Trump have also been affected by this technology. The concern arises from the fact that this technology may pave the way for defamation, blackmail, and threats. Turning technology into a weapon is now much easier… The importance of technology awareness is increasing! Being conscious in the new world dynamics is now more important than ever! As technology advances and internet usage becomes more widespread, information pollution has also begun to increase in the same direction. Situations where we remind ourselves not to believe everything we see will likely become more prevalent with the growth of Deepfake technology. Gaining technological awareness, becoming conscious, has become a crucial position for every individual in today’s world. Our goal should be to turn technology into a tool rather than a weapon through conscious technology use… For this reason, as GFDS, we continue to research, work, and produce.

I was obsessed with work and the mission so I could work upwards of 100 hours a week (I’m sure a lot of this wasn’t productive of course). However that led to plenty of staff churn even when expectations were set clearly before starting. Due to my own burnouts (twice) and also my realisation of growing a successful team I’ve come to realise three important things. 1. If you work 100 hours a week and you want to replace yourself with another CEO* etc. how can you possibly expect them to have the same drive? You are setting yourself and this person up for guaranteed underwhelming failure. 2. Focus is how you overcome the volume issue. By having set business optimisation focusses such as a specific MRR which wills guarantee a buyout number and your customers pure metric — you are empowered to set goals and reject anything that does not align with them. 3. Patience is how you overcome the expectation anxiety. Double the time you expect anything to work as you dream it should. Plan and set expectations with caution and you will reach them sustainably. If your core team works crazy hours so that your burn rate is low (by keeping staff overheads down) and achievements are high — then when you are scaling out your forecasts they are 100% unrealistic because if you replaced yourselves you wouldn’t achieve any of the targets with the same… -- -- Trying: To help people cut through the noise and think more laterally about business.

Let’s find out. Advertising’s actual job has always been to stoke the Engine of Capitalism. And as much as we tend to deny our cog’s part in it, surprise, surprise, that engine mainly runs on the convenience of stored carbon — dinosaur-based petrochemicals used to manufacture the products our creativity sells, to package and ship it, to power much of it, and to replace it with the spanking new, absolutely vital next version within a calendar year. The better we do our jobs, the more our trash bins are filled with the detritus of delicious Thai dinners brought to us by gig-economy-dashers in old, under-maintained gas guzzlers; kept warm in plastic containers that we believe we recycle but actually aren’t recycled at all. Yes, my Pad Kee Mao from last night may be a delicious memory today, but a plastic record of its delivery could still be around in ten thousand years when the alien archaeologists arrive to study our mass marketing tactics through careful excavation of our landfills. These aliens will conclude that our plastics and boxes and electronics and fast food straws were once part of a complex and pervasive religion. And they will not be wrong. “The poor saps,” they’ll say in Venusian. “Behold their late-period design and messaging! They created beautiful religious texts (ads) that won prizes in all the Public Service categories that insisted they were a good and righteous society because they separated their greasy pizza boxes from their Amazon boxes, only to learn too late that all these boxes were reunited for eternity under a counterfeit mountain they made some miles east of what they once called, ‘Los Angeles.’” These aliens are right again. We are indeed very good at being very bad for our own long-term survival. We advertise and design sexy and elaborate packaging for our tech products whose unboxing thrill lasts 4 to 7 seconds. We use the smartphones we find inside to tweet our approval for electric vehicles whose power as often as not comes from a coal-fired electrical grid, and whose manufacturing process is just as environmentally damaging as when we were using it to make a 1969 Dodge Charger with dubious Confederate roof graphics. But wait — are we not actually a thoughtful, future-focused and righteous species with three different colors of wheely trash bins? True, the sterile-pak packaging we place in them has undeniably made us all healthier, and therefore more capable of making more of us. Which in turn, creates more consumption. This spiraling process, supercharged by our genius for advertising psychology, is scheduled to end us just about the time your great grandkids pay their first bill to the smartly branded and advertised, “Amazon Breathable Atmosphere Utility.” Dinosaurs, who as far as we know created very few award-winning advertising campaigns, were so much better at the long game. Still, there’s plenty of blame to go around. If they had never existed, we wouldn’t be burning their millions of years of petro-remains to our detriment. (I will cover all this in my upcoming essay, Brachiosaurus, The Selfish Bastard of the Late Jurrassic.) So if our own creativity is to blame, can our own creativity do anything about it? I, for the purposes of this article, believe we can. And to get the conversation rolling, here are some helpful suggestions/thought starters I propose to everyone free of charge. Unless one actually catches on, at which point I expect to be paid. Strategy One: Branding and Packaging. I propose we create the “Your Grandchild’s Shaking Fist®” label and apply it to every kind of package we design and market. A Good Housekeeping seal for the 21st century (and with luck, the 22nd), it predicts how pissed off your hellscape-surviving future grandchildren will be about your current use of any packaged product — glass bottle packaging gets a wee tsk related to the energy needed to make or recycle it. Plastic bottles of imported water from the South Pacific get a rapidly vibrating clench with the Pre-NRA Charlton Heston Planet of the Apes Statue of Liberty Speech (PNRACHPOTASOLS) flashing in bright orange LEDs below it. (You’ve had half a century to see it, people.) Strategy Two: Retailing. I propose we get someone smarter than me to write an app that tracks your own personal trash pile/trash mountain. It visualizes the garbage you create over time by secretly tracking the UPCs of every product you purchase across your credit and debit card profiles. Those with the tiniest piles will win vacations to the parts of Maui that are still above sea level on luxurious, carbon-neutral sailing yachts; those with massive trash mountains (most of us) will get all our credit cards locked for a year and our Instagram profiles deleted. See you in hell, influencers. Strategy Three: Social Marketing. Shamebots™. Ubiquitious bots that, when your behavior is not planetarily sound, not only shame you via your smart watch and smart speakers, but tell everyone else with a smart watch and/or smart speakers in your NextDoor neighborhood how awful your planet-murdering behavior is. Though, actually, that may already just be the next version of NextDoor. I never said any of these ideas would be original now, did I. Strategy Four: Entertainment Marketing. Culture changes when the culture-making-machine changes. I read that on a blog once. So, from now on I propose we only make and market The Fast and The Furious movies with bikes. And Vin Diesel must change his name to something less fossil-fuel based. Actually this will go for all action movies. All action set pieces must be executed on public transit or electric scooters. You can still blow things up with a missile launcher, but those things must represent the patriarchy. I feel better already. Strategy Five: Political Messaging. Behold the Flaming Policy Visualizer. Input the text of any legislation, then watch as any of its negative consequences, intended or not, appear as Augmented Reality flames that envelop the politician or lobbyist who sponsors it. Powerful AI analyzes the downstream implications of the policy in the context of all other conditions over years or decades. The worse the policy, the more spectacularly the politician immolates. Fun for all ages. See? All we need to do is turn that powerful-creativity-thing that we do around — away from just powering unbridled landfill-filling capitalistic consumerism with supermodels and stock House beats to instead illuminate (in the most energy-efficient way possible) the solutions that will help our future have a future. It will then be up to (now existing) future generations to decide if a future without supermodels and stock House beats is a future worth living in. -- -- Scott is a founder and Executive Chairman for creative firm Bradley and Montgomery (BaMideas.com).

The term was coined by CNBC’s very own, Jim Cramer. Together, the FAANGs amount up to 1% of the total S&P list. In the previous posts, I’ve tried to analyze what businesses can learn from Apple and Google. I suggest you take a look at them in case you haven’t already. blog.goodaudience.com medium.com This time we take a look at Netflix — a company which pioneering niche programming with technology. Every time I open Netflix, time flies as it submerges me with its time clusters. Full of immensely entertaining and interesting content, it’s almost like a crazy time hole. What is Netflix? Quoting Reed Hastings, “The real problem we’re trying to solve is, How do you transform selection so that consumers can find a steady stream of entertainment they love? We give everyone a platform to broaden their tastes.” This has been the core ethos of the company where they’re building what they call a technology behemoth whose analytics, algorithms, and digital-streaming innovations have changed how customers watch TV shows and movies. However, if you broaden your observation lens and scan Netflix again, you would find out them shaping what customers watch and not just how they watch it. Netflix now has 150 mn users and has collected vast amounts of data on their viewing habits — which movies and shows they’ve liked, which they have liked/disliked, how long they’ve watched an individual episode or how much have binged a particular series. This treasure trove of data when coupled with their powerful algorithms helps their engineering team strive to get customers to click on a show in the first 10 seconds. Netflix’s marketing prowess Such an interface, driven by algorithms which keep on getting better with more new data, helps make Netflix’s home screen earn the designation of the world’s most valuable real estate space in television advertising. The outcome? In the final week of 2018, Netflix released “Bird Box” which was watched by 45 million accounts watched in the first week of its release. That’s almost a third of their total user base — a spectacular number even if slightly inflated. (Netflix defined ‘watched’ as getting through 70% of the movie). They’re hell-bent on viewing optimization, internal promotion and maximizing user engagement. The Black Mirror episode of “Bandersnatch” was a mighty successful experiment in an interactive narrative (which I speculate is purely from the perspective of data harvesting). With this, users get to choose what happens in the narrative from dozens of options. Netflix can now chart out the narrative choices from the viewer activity helping them in their programming decisions and customizing promotions to each subscriber. What do you get when you combine interactive narratives and programmatic product placement? Ans — A blatant potential marketing technique. There were several choices for the users which have minimal impact on the narrative — choosing the cereal (along with its packaging) for instance or choosing which song to play from the cassette while driving. The true ‘red’ Sillicon Valley disruptor? If you aim to disrupt an industry, you must be nimble, willing to disrupt yourself. It started off being a new entrant that reshaped the logic of an entire industry. Yet one of the most interesting trajectories over the last two decades has how dramatically it has disrupted itself to keep its skin in the game. It started doing something like Amazon — shipping DVDs by mail and abolishing late fees. Now it has transitioned from mailing content to streaming those digitally. Today, it’s also a noteworthy original content creator getting 112 Emmy nominations. It also spent over $12 billion cash in making original content in 2018. Aptly put by a cover story in New York magazine, “Netflix is hiring in and out of Hollywood to make more TV shows than any network ever has, and it also knows which one you will like”. There were only so many ways through which you could pay for entertainment/media — lease a movie seat, watch ads alongside radio or television and/or pay a fat monthly fee to gain access to an array of scheduled programming. Netflix was a fresh foray, providing ad-free original programming alongside a library of older content for a monthly fee. It has transformed several norms of the TV business — from eliminating pilot episodes to inventing the concept of binge-watching (particularly because of the convenience) to replacing demographics with taste-clusters. Netflix has always challenged the conventions of the industry and could well be the classical definition of a Sillicon Valley disruptor. How do the financials hold up! Netflix purely relies on subscribers whom it pays so much unlimited content for such a low monthly rate averaging around $14/month meaning it earns the same from each household regardless of how much the subscribers watch. And it’s burning through money with $3 billion negative cash flow in 2018 alone. Pouring money into content might generate hits, not revenues and since it relies so heavily on subscriptions, its entire valuation is centered around the concept of adding and retaining subscribers. Albeit it posted $1.2 billion in profits, those numbers are based on an accounting model which neglects many costs and debts. This has attracted severe criticism from financial experts like Aswath Damodaran, who believe that the model is unsustainable. Netflix’s entire valuation is based on hope, hope that it will keep on additing subscribers at a massive pace and economics of scale would kick in sometime. Netflix wants you to occupy your leisure time Netflix first communicated its interests in competing with all activities that consumers have at their disposal in their leisure time in late 2013 in its “Long-term plan”. They keep iterating how they currently occupy only a small fraction of their users’ leisure time and money. What if Netflix was pitting itself against social media companies like Facebook and Google (YouTube)? Netflix might be playing a dangerous game but it ain’t doing that recklessly. The winner will command untold spoils. Yet their business models remain starkly contrasting — the social media giants have advertising revenues from free user-generated content. Netflix could aim to balance content costs with higher subscription fees but it would only lead to small profit margins. But what if the parallel isn’t restricted to costs and revenue? Their competitive advantage (as I already mentioned earlier) has long been their recommendation algorithm. Now if it wants users to binge-watch on its platform (as it’s spending a lot on improving its algorithm), it invariably signals to its intentions to compete with content platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. Imagine it having 300–400 million subscribers (with an average user sharing his/her profile with 2 more), each spending roughly 2 hours on the service, Netflix would have built a platform where paid users have far greater engagement than Facebook. This “reach” (number of users * frequency) is phenomenally powerful. Add live sports, interactive story-telling or even cloud gaming (for Netflix still has the best at-scale and compression technology in the world) and countless possibilities mushroom up. How can Netflix live up to its potential? Netflix could try and become a Multi-sided platform (MSP). Why? Many MSPs are more valuable than companies in the same domain providing only products and services. For instance, Airbnb is more valuable than Marriott, the world’s largest hotel chain. And it has incredible reach (150 million subscribers) and content delivery infrastructure would be really attractive to many. In addition to video content providers, cloud gaming services and marketers. By becoming an MSP, Netflix could tap into a different dimension of growth — selling more to the same set of subscribers. How could Netflix be a platform? It would be fairly simple for Netflix to become a platform if it wanted to. It could allow third-parties to sell their products and services with Netflix’s service but outside their subscription, on mutually agreed upon terms. This way Netflix wouldn’t have to buy or produce new content to grow. It just needs to attract third parties to develop and sell the content. The third-parties benefit from Netflix’s extensive content delivery capabilities while Netflix keeps a share of the revenue or a transaction fee. Moreover, such parties would experiment with new forms of content which would really help consolidate Netflix’s content production and licensing efforts. This is a page straight out of Amazon’s playbook — build a platform to entice third party sellers, study their transactions and then copy them (Amazon Basics). The melting pot is that Netflix is struggling in an increasingly crowded space. Netflix might have to switch from being a pure aggregator of content under one single piece of subscription to a hybrid aggregator platform model on which various content providers can tap into its 150 million strong user base. Does Netflix need to worry about its competition? The stock dipped ~4.5% the day Disney+ was announced. Of course, the competition is coming & it’s getting crowded with everyone vying for cord-cutter $s. However, I feel it’s their game to lose. Outside the US, it has less competition & a strong competitive advantage. Let’s see how — Only 60 out of its 140 mn subscribers happen to be from the US — almost close to the potential market which means international revenues will outweigh domestic. Better still, Disney+ wouldn’t be global before ’21 & seems like AppleTV would only be available in a few countries. Hulu & HBO now are in the US only. Even Prime Video doesn’t have country-specific & local language content. It’s ramping up international content & also spending on building for local audiences — giving money to local creators & letting them make great content based on the data they’ve collected about user behavior. HBO wouldn’t make a Hindi GoT. Neither Disney would attempt a German Avengers. It’s this appetite which won them the Oscar for Best Foreign language film. If it keeps pouring more money into quality international content, it could acquire 300 mn intl. subscribers real quick. Q1 report suggests it’s precisely focussed on international growth & that should deliver results for the stakeholders. Closing thoughts The leading streamer of on-demand content has a strong culture and is worth keeping an eye on if you wish to learn business strategies from it. But ultimately, the power of Netflix is to keep you hooked on to its platform for long. And as it grows, so will this power (and also debt?). It sits at the nerve center of a popular culture thanks to its very millennial-centric demographic. It possesses very powerful algorithms — both compression and recommendation wise — which when combined with its 150 million users gives it a solid value proposition which can directly translate into revenue through a variety of means. Its primary long-term business goal might well be to become a data-aggregation company and not a media/distribution company. This changes the entire paradigm once we consider this.

And, in fact, online review sites have transformed the way we make consumer decisions. The appeal of online forums on Yelp, Amazon, TripAdvisor, and countless other sites, is to offer a wide range of opinions that, taken together, give consumers the scoop about the real quality and worth of a product or service.

Ten years down the line, a lot of things have changed. Arguably, even the very notion of decentralisation which lies at the heart of the blockchain, has undergone modifications in its context and application. Today, the use cases of DLT seem to be mushrooming across the contours of the tech industry. With the changing backdrop in mind, we ask: Different experts have different views. I personally feel that it’s necessary to subscribe to a clear vision of what blockchain really is and where it should be headed, in order to make sure the industry can soar to the heights it was destined for.

These errors appear in the form of messages such as the Fine Cartridge isn’t installed properly or Fine Cartridge is not installed for 1401. Even though many of the messages stating Canon fine cartridge doesn’t mean that a printer individual is using the exact cartridges of canon installed in the device. The printer individual can utilize the cartridges which are properly refilled. Therefore, some of the steps are described below to resolve canon printer error code 1401. Steps to Resolve the Canon Printer Error Code 1401 Step 1: Ensure that you have installed Black and colored Cartridges Accurately The first thing you need to do is to turn on your printer and then take out the cartridges to ensure that each of them is installed in an exact way. In order to print the cartridges in an exact way, you should have both the colour and black cartridges. Step 2: Look At the Cartridge Code of the Printer If you want to get rid of error then it is very important to properly install the cartridges. For the coloured printers, you also need to ensure that it is properly carrying the code of the machine. Moreover, the code accuracy depends upon the particular model of the printer. Step 3: Clean the Contacts Correctly It is very significant for printer contact to have a statement with the printer cartridge which is made up of metallic contacts. Printer contacts are placed on the band to the front of the cartridge. So, it becomes necessary for the individual to clean the parts that are damaged. Step 4: Replace or Remove All the Ink Cartridges that are Faulty If you fail to identify the printer then in such case the cartridge is faulty and it has to be removed directly. Most probably your canon printer error code 1401 will get fixed after replacing the ink cartridges that are malfunctioning. Moreover, we will advise you to choose a canon original ink cartridge for replacing. Step 5: Clean All the Contact Present Inside the Printer If an error still seems then the only thing you can do is to clean all the contacts that are present inside the printer. You have to clean them in a comparable way as you clean the cartridges contacts. But you should be careful while cleaning it doesn’t leave scraps of tissues on the contacts.

However, data from Pitchbook shows that it’s still relatively hard to become a unicorn. My analysis shows that over the span of a 20 year period, less than 8% of the companies that have attained $100M post-money valuations have become unicorns. Since most of the unicorns are in the U.S. and that’s the market I’m most familiar with, I wanted to see how many of the U.S. VC-backed companies that hit a $100M valuation proceeded to become unicorns (insert witty name for 1/10 of a unicorn). Also, is the VC market correlated to public markets? Let’s find out. Below is a graph that shows the proportion of U.S. VC-backed companies valued at $100M that ultimately went on to become unicorns (huuuuuge shoutout to the Pitchbook research team for compiling the data for me). I felt it was important to go back 20 years to get data and see the impact of major moments in the public stock markets (i.e. tech bubble burst in early 2000s, Great Recession in 2008, Great Recovery 2010+). Below is the same data in tabular format for additional clarity: First thing to note is that the steep decline starting in 2014 is likely due to the fact that companies during that year and beyond haven’t had enough time to achieve unicorn status. I will have to dig into more of the data around the speed of attaining unicorn status (stay tuned!) for the purpose of this analysis, but it has historically taken a long time. This link here from fleximize shows that most companies that are unicorns take anywhere from 6–10+ years to hit that goal. There are exceptions to this — Bird became a unicorn in less than a year after it was founded! Besides that, there are some interesting findings from the data: In my opinion, here are the most important takeaways: There are certainly a lot of unicorns in the wild these days, but the data shows they are still special… for now. For startup founders, it’s important to keep the pedal to the metal. From a portfolio construction perspective, investors should be cautiously optimistic when their companies hit a $100M valuation. -- -- 2 VC @ Honeywell Ventures Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*DT_yvjYzg73dqbuj48YYHg@2x.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*DT_yvjYzg73dqbuj48YYHg@2x.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*DT_yvjYzg73dqbuj48YYHg@2x.jpeg"

We build apps for everyday employees to more efficiently go about their day-to-day. In this dynamic, our customers are enterprise companies, but our users are “consumers” within those enterprises. Our customer contacts are usually directors of IT who make our products available to the end users, within their company. Ideas, without execution, are just ideas. A major part of executing on an idea, and turning it into a product, is testing your assumptions and iterating based on your findings. It’s a critical part of ensuring you’re building for impact and ultimately, finding product-market fit. An important step in how I build a product is user testing. We were looking for consumer-type users, without an agenda specific to our offering, to test our product. It’s easy to get someone to test your designs and provide feedback. It’s not as easy in B2B Saas to identify and engage target users who can provide unbiased input. The more familiar your testers are of your product, the more biased the input will be. Feedback from people within your company is the path of least resistance, but also the most tainted. Power-users or contacts at your favorite customers are easily accessible, but often have feature-driven agendas when “testing” your designs. We were looking for consumer-type users, without an agenda specific to our offering, to test our product. Identify and engage target users who can provide unbiased input. The secret? Sugar and Swag. Here’s what we did: Rather than make it a burden on the customer, we turned user testing into a benefit. I didn’t have much of a budget, so I had to figure out how to incentivize people to test the prototype. We couldn’t afford to hand out gift cards, especially because people don’t value cards under $10, so we chose something most people enjoy — donuts. We called up our local customers and asked if we could come by and set up a table in their lunchroom. The table would have 75 free donuts, a few t-shirts, and a cool prototype anyone could test if they wanted to. That was it, we promised to be set up and out of the office in less than 2 hours. Once we offered free donuts for their coworkers, our contact at the company got excited (because they would be the one who facilitated free donuts) and made it happen. It was simple. As people walked by we asked if they wanted a donut — most people wanted a donut. We then said they could have one if they spent 30 seconds and tested our prototype — most people considered 30 seconds a fine compromise for a donut. In that first swarm testing session, we had around 80 people test the prototype and provide input. We then went back to the office, spent a few days iterating the prototype from what we learned, and did it again at another office. We did this about 6 times with design iterations after each session. Swarm testing was incredibly efficient and effective — but isn’t right for every product. Swarm testing, as we now call it, came out of the need to connect with hard to reach users. I was surprised at how effective it was, but that’s the joy of a startup —we came up with the idea and knew within a week if we were on to something. Morgan Williams, who led product design for this did a write-up on this same experience; it’s a better read IMO. -dal we did this back in Q3 2018 Thanks for reading!

Rather than be buried six feet under or be cremated into ash — both options which provide a 0% chance of ever coming back to life — cryonics proposes the cryopreservation of the clinically deceased in the hopes of someday reanimating them back to life at a later date. And while the practice remains controversial, with many throughout the scientific community expressing skepticism that the practice will even work, we cryonicists aren’t driven by fanciful guarantees, but rather the hope, however small it may be, that we’ll someday achieve a second chance at life.

But, in order for robots to perform more versatile tasks, they’re going to need to be able to work together. Instead of a single robot endlessly placing objects in a box, imagine a whole swarm of small robots working together to gather items and pack them. A new processor developed by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology is designed specifically for that kind of work, and consumes very little power. The chip they developed is actually more than just a processor, but the major breakthrough is a “hybrid digital-analog time-domain processor” that allows it to operate with very little power. The chip would allow a small, palm-sized robot to operate on just a few milliwatts, meaning it could run for hours on a single charge. Special low-power motors and sensors would help to keep power consumption as low as possible. Simple efficiency won’t be enough to really usher in a new future of robotics, however. A swarm of small robots also needs to be able to work together efficiently, which means they need to communicate and process tasks effectively. These chips have built-in means of communication, and were designed with “collaborative reinforcement learning” in mind. Essentially, robots using this chip would be able to run for several hours while working in sync to accomplish a wide range of goals. -- -- 1 Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg"

Ein Ziel sind selbstlernende Systeme, die komplexe Muster und Gesetzmäßigkeiten in Daten erkennen, um auf dieser Basis fundiertere und effizientere Entscheidungen zu treffen. Eine wichtige Grundlage dafür ist maschinelles Lernen, weil die Technik dadurch ähnlich funktioniert wie das menschliche Gehirn. Viele Institute treiben aktuell die Digitalisierung voran, um ihre Prozesse zu optimieren und sich vertrieblich in einer Omnikanal-Welt neu aufzustellen. Aber reicht das aus, um gut durch die nächste Krise zu kommen? Fakt ist, dass bereits heute (theoretisch) ein Großteil der manuellen Prozesse bei Kreditinstituten durch Automatisierung und Digitalisierung auf ein neues Level gehoben werden könnte. Der Kunde honoriert deutlich verkürzte End-to-End-Durchlaufzeiten und schätzt auch die digitalisierten Nebenprozesse (zum Beispiel digitaler Finanzbericht). Bereits heute sind erste automatisierte Systeme für Kreditentschei­dungen erfolgreich im Einsatz. In der Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe wird kanalübergreifend von zahlreichen Instituten die sogenannte Aktivlinie im privaten und gewerblichen Bereich genutzt — und das sehr erfolg­reich. Um die Prozesse zu verschlanken und schneller Kreditent­schei­dun­gen zu treffen, wird Kunden teilnehmender Institute automatisiert diese Aktivlinie eingeräumt. In der Praxis können Kredite bis zu einer festgelegten Höhe (derzeit maximal 100 000 Euro) damit in einem vereinfachten Verfahren unmit­telbar auf allen Kanälen zugesagt werden. Die Höhe der kundenindivi­duellen Aktivlinie ist dabei von verschiedenen Parametern abhängig: Ausgangspunkt der Berechnung ist etwa der approximierte Geschäfts­umsatz der vergangenen Monate. Während die Berechnungslogik initial definiert wurde und nur bedingt anpassbar ist, werden für ausgewählte Berechnungsparameter lediglich Verbandsempfehlungen ausgesprochen. Diese können anschließend durch die Institute individuell modifiziert werden. Systeme wie die Aktiv­linie nutzen dabei größtenteils Parameter, die auf historischen Werten basieren, Expertenschätzungen umfassen und nur stichtags­bezogen ermittelt werden. Es handelt sich somit um ein nicht-lernendes System, das regelmäßig durch manuelle Anpassungen von Parametern weiter­entwickelt werden muss. Obwohl die Aktivlinie im Mengengeschäft gute Ergebnisse erzielt, lässt sich die Qualität der Kreditentscheidung durch den Einsatz künstlicher Intelligenz deutlich verbessern. Heute werden für Kreditentscheidungen im Wesentlichen noch stark vereinfachende, statische Modelle genutzt, die mit vergleichsweise wenigen Daten beziehungsweise Parametern (zum Beispiel Haus­halts­einkommen) „gefüttert” werden. Solche Systeme arbeiten meist unter der Annahme, dass es einen simplen, linearen Zusammenhang zwischen den betrachteten Parametern und der Kreditwürdigkeit des Kunden gibt. Daraus resultiert zwar ein einfach zu interpretierendes Modell, das mitunter jedoch die komplexe Lebenswirklichkeit vernach­lässigt, die die Kreditwürdigkeit aber unmittelbar beeinflusst. Weiter vertraut man bei diesen Modellen darauf, dass die Parameter, auf deren Basis die automatisierten Entscheidungen getroffen werden, vom Menschen bei der Modellentwicklung richtig definiert worden sind. So nutzen automatisierte Kreditvergabesysteme oft den approximierten Geschäftsumsatz als Entscheidungsfaktor. Was jedoch, wenn etwa der Geschäftsgewinn in Wirklichkeit der weitaus effektivere Entscheidungs­faktor sein sollte? Das entwickelte System würde ständig unzureichende Entscheidungen fällen, da ihm bereits beim Start die „falschen” Entschei­dungsfaktoren an die Hand gegeben worden sind. Das automatische Lernen und Aktualisieren dieser Faktoren — basierend auf Daten von Tausenden zuvor getroffenen Kreditentscheidungen — und deren Ausgang findet in einem statischen System zudem nicht statt. Um es anzupassen, wäre eine manuelle Aktualisierung des Systems von außen erforderlich. Dabei sind Kreditinstitute durch die Möglichkeiten künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) heute bereits in der Lage, selbstlernende Systeme zu entwickeln, die komplexe Muster und Gesetzmäßigkeiten in Daten erkennen und auf dieser Basis fundierte Entscheidungen treffen. Ein künstlich geschaffe­nes System gilt dann als intelligent, wenn es kognitive Funktionen eines Menschen beziehungsweise Lebewesens hat (zum Beispiel die Fähigkeit zu lernen oder das Lösen von Problemen). Vor allem das Lernen wird über das breite Feld des Machine Learnings (maschinelles Lernen) adressiert. Ein Teilgebiet, das sogenannte Deep Learning, hat in der Vergangenheit besonders viel Aufmerksamkeit er­regt, weil es in den Bereichen maschinelles Sehen (Computer Vision) und Sprachverarbeitung (Natural Language Processing) besonders erfolgreich eingesetzt worden ist. Teilweise konnten KI-Systeme bereits das Leistungsniveau des Menschen nicht nur erreichen, sondern sogar übertreffen (zum Beispiel im Brettspiel Go). Wie die Technologie arbeitet, zeigt exemplarisch Abbildung 1. Daten werden bei diesem Verfahren von Experten manuell gesichtet, zusammengefasst und ausgewählt, um sie für spezifische Machine-Learning-Modelle (im Beispiel: Ent­scheidungs­bäume) aufzubereiten. Die Modelle sind weniger rechenintensiv und können selbst mit kleineren Datenmengen gute Ergebnisse liefern. Methoden des maschinellen Lernens sind deshalb statistische Verfah­ren, die auf (meist tabellenförmigen) Daten basieren. Sie bestehen aus teilweise Hunderten oder mehr Attributen, die das Problem beschreiben. Dabei wird stets anhand einer hinreichend großen Daten­basis versucht, generelle Gesetzmäßigkeiten aus den Daten automatisiert zu erkennen und zu lernen. Vor dem eigentlichen Lernprozess erfordern klassische Machine-Lear­ning-Algorithmen in der Regel eine sehr aufwendige Vor- und Aufberei­tung der Daten. Die Parameter (Features) müssen im ersten Schritt meist aus mehreren Datenquellen konsolidiert und extrahiert, um im zweiten Schritt gesäubert, sinnvoll umgewandelt und normalisiert werden zu können. Beide Schritte sind nicht nur sehr zeitintensiv — de facto die aufwendigste Phase im gesamten Prozess -, sondern erfor­dern auch viel Erfahrung und ein tiefes, fachliches Verständnis. Bezogen auf Systeme, die über Kreditbewilligung entscheiden sollen, bedeutet dies, dass Daten früherer Kreditentscheidungen parametrisiert und sämtliche Entscheidungsgründe maschinell lesbar dargestellt wer­den müssen. Mit derart trainierten Modellen sind dann für künftige Daten fundiertere Aussagen zur Kreditwürdigkeit anhand der Merkmale der Anfrage (der sogenannte Inferenzschritt) möglich. Da das System die Entscheidungen automa­tisch auf der Basis historischer Daten getroffen hat, sind sie er­wie­senermaßen statistisch optimal. Darüber hinaus können die Parame­ter dieser Modelle mit neuen Daten kontinuierlich aktualisiert und somit dynamisch sich ändernden Umständen angepasst werden. Abbildung 2 zeigt an einem Beispiel die Funktionsweise von Deep Lear­ning (tiefgehendes Lernen). Das tiefe neuronale Netz lernt automatisch hochkomplexe Zusammenhänge in den Daten. Das Training ist äußerst rechenintensiv und erfordert meist große Datenmengen. Deep Learning steht deshalb für eine bestimmte Methodenfamilie des maschinellen Lernens. Basierend auf sogenannten künstlichen neurona­len Netzen, die der Funktionsweise des menschlichen Gehirns nach­empfunden sind, verfügen sie über eine enorm hohe Abstraktions­fähig­keit. Dieser Ansatz eignet sich daher vor allem bei komplexen Datenty­pen wie Bildern oder Tönen, deren semantische Aussa­gekraft implizit enthalten ist. Sie können Gesichter in einem Pixel-Bild unterscheiden oder Sprachkonstrukte in einer Audiodatei erkennen. Schlüssel für eine solch starke Abstraktionsfähigkeit ist, dass Daten nicht wie im klassi­schen maschinellen Lernen mühsam per Hand aufbereitet werden müssen, sondern die beste Datenrepräsentation automatisch gelernt wird. Das macht Deep Learning zu einem Univer­salwerkzeug, das beliebig komplexe Zusammen­hänge lernen kann, sofern hinreichende Datenmengen und Rechen­kapazitäten vorhanden sind. Aktuell ist jedoch nur ein Bruchteil der Kundeninformationen digital verfügbar, um sie in statistischen Modellen berücksichtigen zu können. Grund dafür ist, dass trotz verstärkter Standardisierung im Vertriebs­prozess (zum Beispiel Finanzkonzept der Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe) Kreditent­scheidungen immer noch stark von Kundengesprächen oder anderen, teilweise schwierig zu quantifizierbaren Faktoren abhängig sind. Eine Lösung zur Erfassung der Informationen könnte die automatisierte Spracherfassung sein. Moderne Sprache-zu-Text-Systeme sind heute schon in der Lage, Gesprächen in Echtzeit zu folgen. Beispiel für eine solche Technologie ist der Google-Übersetzungsdienst, der nicht nur Text erfasst, während jemand spricht, sondern diesen gleichzeitig in eine andere Sprache übersetzt. Die durch ein solches System generierten Daten beziehungsweise Informationen können bereits heute mithilfe künstlicher Intelligenz automatisiert in Themen unterteilt und nach Schlüsselwörtern sortiert werden. Daraus ableiten lässt sich sogar die generelle Grund­stimmung des Kommunizierenden. Diese Daten könnten eine weitere Datenquelle für ein Kreditrankingsystem sein, das schon aus unzähligen vorausgegangenen Kundengesprächen gelernt hat, welche Teile und Nuancen der Unterhaltung wichtig für eine finale Entscheidung der Kreditwürdigkeit sind. Neben den während eines Beratungsgesprächs erhobenen Daten benö­tigen KI-Systeme jedoch auch „Erfahrungswerte” beziehungsweise Daten, auf deren Basis sie „lernen” können. Für Kreditinstitute sind solche Daten je­doch eine große Herausforderung: Durch die 2018 europaweit einge­führte Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO) gelten für das Speichern personenbezogener Daten nämlich strikte Auflagen. Die daraus resul­tierende geringere Datendichte führt zu einem klaren Wettbewerbs­nach­teil gegenüber US-amerikanischen beziehungsweise asiatischen Instituten. Künstliche Intelligenz ist heute schon in der Finanzwirtschaft einsetzbar und verspricht bei entsprechender Vorbereitung deutliche Effizienz- und Zeitge­winne. Zu einem Engpass in den Kreditinstituten könnte das benö­tigte KI-Fachwissen werden. Der Hauptgrund: Bei großen US-amerikani­schen Tech-Konzernen wie Google oder Amazon sind frühzeitig große Budgets bereitgestellt worden, um Absolventen und KI-Experten anheu­ern zu können. Dadurch sind Jahres­gehälter von mehreren Hundert­tausend US-Dollar möglich, was den Tech-Firmen ein deutliches Wissensmonopol verschafft.

Technology still evolving with every passing day, Tech companies across the world is experimenting with tech. Tech firms are creating new wave of products to make life easier for the consumers. More and more websites are now implementing Chatbots to drive marketing and garner new leads. You will have heard the line somewhere in the web: Chatbots are the future. This is hardly news to many considering we are seeing Chatbots being the center point of discussion around the tech conferences. E-Commerce firms were the first to look at the possibility of Chatbots in the day-to-day operations. Chatbot can do a normal conversation with a visitor on the website and can undertake tasks for you. A chatbot can help you order food, book appointments, buy stuff online and more. Chatbots base is NLP (Natural Language Processing) to gauge the user texts and reply effectively. Top Critical Chatbots Statistics: AI powered Chatbots are already in play, the common use cases in play are: Self Service as in Customer Queries Resolving and Answering Gathering Initial Information and Data Guiding the users to the various product and services available Booking appointment for patients at a hospital Answering Banking Queries Rise of the Chatbots: a More personalized experience powered by the AI People are spending more and more time on Internet, Websites are now exploring Chatbots to engage on a wider level with incoming website traffic visitors. The most advanced Chatbots are powered by AI are understanding user requests, engage with the visitors while improving interactions and garnering qualified leads. Chatbots improves e-commerce firms to reduce manual control of customer support and engage with better with consumers 24 /7 * 365. Chatbots are available all the time and makes sure that the sales and transactions are happening all the time. Chatbots disseminates information to the customers swiftly, efficiently than a human customer could. How can Chatbots benefit the business? Call centers will becoming obsolete in the coming days as the Chatbots will be the source of information for the Consumers. Chatbots are answering the user questions and directing them to a human agent in case of complexities. Inexpensive and accurate, Chatbots are being experimented and implemented by numbers of Industries, Fortune 500 Firms, Smaller firms among others. There is no ceiling to the Chatbots use cases as they are providing solutions using the medium where the consumers are hooked to currently- Messaging. In the coming days, Voice enabled Chatbots will be the course of action. Chatbots will work similar to the other voice assistants in vogue like Siri, Alexa, Cortana. The Chatbots will use AI tech to access costumer data, records, and sales purchases to make better uniformed conversation. Advertisement is one field which uses tech to push ads and conversation with the prospective consumers. Improve Customer Engagement: Companies that offer multiple products and services have the maximum benefit scope of Chatbots. Immediate engagement is the game changer. Here, below our AI powered Chatbots interacts with the user and offers him the flights at the best rate for a travel destination. 5 Reasons why Chatbots will be the future of Digital Economy: Chatbots and Customers are interlinked: The modern consumer is online and surfing through your website and products at any random time. Modern consumers are accessing the website through mobile, tablet, desktop or maybe using Alexa too. The consumer is modern and self aware, firms also needs to be at the same level of technical proficiency. Chatbots is one option to do that. Chatbots offers a unique 24/7 engagement experience across platforms to help the firms get in new clients. Increasing Engagement/Interaction From the monotonous yes/no to imitating human agent conversation flow, Chatbots have come a long way. Meaningful opening line to interesting lines to engage the user to emojis, Chatbots are now driving forward the conversation and keeping the visitors hooked on the website. Managing the high consumer flow Often, there would be a huge spike in a website that would put the human resources deployed to engage the users under a huge strain. Educational websites will see a spike of student’s visitor during the exam time period. Chatbots can handle the multiple queries and give uniform standardized Interactions. Find New Leads The global chatbot market is expected to exceed $1.34 billion valuation by 2024 according to multiple reports. The market is going to explode and a chance to gain a foothold is something every firm will take a heed. Chatbots have simply ceased being a new tech tool to a solution bringing new customers who were just visitors/traffic on the website. An automated robust Customer service is one segment which will be a big part of the E-Commerce or Service focused firms. Chatbots would solve customer general queries and translate those customers into a new consumer base for the websites. Cost Optimization/24*7*365 Availability Chatbots are powered by AI and Machine Learning; they resolve tickets raised by the consumer’s swift enabling customer satisfaction. Chatbot reduces the cost for the company in hiring resources who needs to be deployed in shifts to tackle the vast number of queries arising on the website. So, what’s ahead for the Chatbots? Future looks rosy for the Chatbots as the firm’s looks forward to engage with the consumers and market their product effectively. Chatbots are critical in bringing new business as they will interact in the form of automated chats with new visitors/people thus translating to more sales, financial transactions and revenues. Chatbots possess the inherent capacity to interact with more number of consumers than the normal human agents who are live on the site would be able to do. As Machine learning advances, we won’t be able to identify the conversation of a Chatbot from the human agent would normally do. Retail Consumer Goods Industry, e-commerce, travel & hospitality are some of the industries where Chatbots would be making a huge impact. -- -- IntelliTicks is a hybrid chatbot platform that combines human agents and AI for delivering better customer experience.

As parents, we need to be able to spot the difference. As the Founder & CEO of a tech company that’s building products for kids, I often get questions from other parents. When I tell them what I do, the conversation almost always turns to screen time. When should we introduce screen time? How much is too much? And I’m far from the only person fielding these queries. One of my advisors is Dr. Renae Beaumont, an Assistant Professor of Psychology in Clinical Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medicine, and creator the Secret Agent Society. She tells me that screen time is the number one concern she hears from parents today. I think these questions are especially pressing now because we’re in the midst of a significant transition: parents have largely accepted that technology is a major part of their lives — and their children’s lives. It no longer seems like a feasible option to shelter your kids from screens. While it’s great that parents are thinking critically about screen time, they’re actually asking the wrong question. It’s not about how much screen time is appropriate; the more important concern is the type of screen time. In addition to thinking about total time online, we need to take a close look at what our children are doing on their tablets, smartphones and hand-me-down devices. For our family, navigating the issue of screen time became easier when I started distinguishing between “screen time” and “screen captured.” The last thing I want to do is encourage technophobia. In fact, I’m a firm believer that technology can have a positive impact on us and our kids. Just think about the incredible amount of information that kids have access to — literally at their fingertips. When used responsibly, technology can open up minds and introduce adventure. Growing up pre-internet, this kind of access to knowledge is something I couldn’t have imagined in my youth. I was limited to what I could find at the local library or in my parent’s encyclopedia set. I still remember the day that we got our first CD-ROM encyclopedia, which seems quaint now, but was nothing short of mind-blowing at the time. As an eager student, I relied on this new technology to improve my school work. But the 700 megabyte capacity of a CD-ROM is nothing compared to the amount of information on the internet. Just between Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook servers, there is an estimated 1.2 million terabytes of data! Many, many orders of magnitude more information than what I had access to as a kid — and when used responsibly, it’s an invaluable resource for young learners. I’ve witnessed firsthand how access to information can inspire kids. My daughter uses tech to learn about anything and everything on her mind, and I coach her on how to ask the right questions in search engines, and identify reliable results. This week, she learned about birthstones (and she’s concluded that my ruby is prettier than her opal). Under parental supervision, she also plays games like Roblox and Minecraft — which help hone her problem solving, creativity and collaboration skills. And you can’t talk about tech without talking about connection. My daughter is able to stay in touch with family and friends in a way that simply wasn’t possible before the internet. When we moved to Vancouver in 2017, she had to leave friends behind. It used to be that, when a kid moved away, that was the last you saw of them. Today, my daughter uses FaceTime to talk to far-away friends and family — and we’ve even used tech to plan a visit with an old schoolmate she hasn’t physically seen in over a year. Finally, screens can provide endless entertainment. Sure, I had TV when I was young, but there was only a few hours each day of child-friendly programming. Thanks to Netflix, YouTube and on-demand TV, there’s always something entertaining and appropriate for my daughter to enjoy. We watch a lot of shows together, and she spends a lot of time on the YouTube channels I’ve pre-approved. I also have a 22-month-old son, and yes, I’ll admit that my wife and I occasionally put him in front Baby Shark, because he loves it and it gives us a small break. These are just a few examples of how screen time has had a positive impact on my children. With proper supervision, the wealth of information on the internet can help kids learn. Games can encourage skill development. Devices can solidify connections with loved ones. And of course, Baby Shark can induce giggles. There is big difference though between our kids enjoying screen time, and our kids becoming “screen captured”. “Screen captured” is the term I use to describe the problematic screen time parents should reduce or eliminate. Every one of us can become screen captured by technology that’s intentionally designed to manipulate and influence our behaviour — and our kids are especially vulnerable. In September 2019, I’ll be publishing my book Screen Captured, which explores the phenomenon at length, but I’ll share a key takeaway in the meantime. Screen capture relies on many different mechanisms, but the most common are algorithms and social validation metrics. Algorithms have been a hot topic in the media lately — and a lot of the press has been negative. An algorithm, however, is not inherently evil; it’s just a set of rules that tells a computer how to perform a particular task. They have many different applications, but a lot of social media and e-commerce platforms use algorithms to analyze your data and “personalize” what you see. I’m actually thankful for algorithms when I scroll through my Twitter and LinkedIn feeds, because they help to ensure I see posts I’ll be interested in. Similarly, Amazon’s algorithms make personalized suggestions, and I’ve added books and the odd 24-pack of toilet paper to my cart when they pop up in my recommendations. I use these platforms actively, but I am also acutely aware of the fact the algorithms are at work. I’m consciously choosing to trade a few subliminally-induced impulse purchases in exchange for a more relevant, personalized feed. But I’m an adult. Kids don’t yet have the agency to choose those tradeoffs, and they and won’t have the self-awareness to recognize when an algorithm is pulling at their synapses. Kids shouldn’t use platforms with algorithm-curated news feeds — including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat — at least not without close supervision. Parents are also well advised to heed the 13+ age limit in the terms of service. YouTube deserves special attention here because it’s the number one platform for kids under 13. While it doesn’t have a “feed” per se, it still operates with an algorithm designed to pull you in. Since I’ve already shared how my daughter enjoys the platform, I’m not going to tell you to ban it for your kids. I’ll just warn you that the recommended videos can draw your kids into a proverbial rabbit hole. The way it works is by analyzing your viewing history, and suggesting similar content. But remember, YouTube doesn’t just do this to keep you endlessly entertained. They do it to keep you screen captured and show you as many ads as possible in the process. The danger of the manipulation is not just in the advertisements. One recent study found that toddlers have a 45% chance of clicking through to inappropriate content within just ten recommended videos. The authors of the study identified the “dangers of crowd-sourced, uncurated content combined with engagement-oriented, gameable recommendation systems,” and I have to say I share their concerns, especially when family members are sharing a device. When the algorithm can’t distinguish between users, recommendations get jumbled together, and your toddler might see suggestions based on your teenager’s recent views. Algorithms can screen capture you by serving you content you like. But there’s arguably an even greater danger when you’re on a platform that uses social validation to show you exactly how many people like you. Vanity metrics are ubiquitous across platforms, and they lead to screen capture by giving us a sense of social validation. Likes and follower counts — among other metrics — are known to trigger dopamine our brain the same way gambling does. We anticipate a reward when we post on a social channel, and it’s no accident that tech companies exploit this human drive to feel accepted. It’s an intentional strategy to hook you in, and the platforms reap the benefit of increased daily and monthly active users who are actually addicted. Recently, many of the people involved in designing platforms like Facebook and Instagram have spoken out about the addictive nature of the design. Tristan Harris, a former Google Product Manager, has been one of the most outspoken critics of addictive design. In a recent interview, he took aim at the Snapchat “streak” feature, which shows the number of days in a row that you’ve exchanged messages with a friend. According to Harris, kids are so stressed about their streak that, when they go on vacation, they actually give their password to other kids to keep the streaks going on their behalf. So he asks the question, “when these features are being designed, are they designed to help people live their life, or are they being designed because they’re best at hooking people into using the product?” You can probably guess how I would answer that question. If you are tempted to write addictive design off as an unintended consequence, all you need to do is read a quote from Facebook’s founding president, Sean Parker, which is downright chilling. “We need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo or a post. And that’s going to get you to contribute more content, and that’s going to get you… more likes and comments. It’s a social validation feedback loop… exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology,” he says. So just imagine what this is doing to a developing brain. In that same interview, Parker might have said it best: “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” There are apps targeted to children that feature likes and follower counts, and even incentivize kids to amass followers by doling out rewards at different levels. TikTok, for example, is a hugely popular app, and likes are one of its core features. What’s truly troubling is the growing body of evidence that links vanity metrics to recent spikes in anxiety, depression and suicide rates among teens, especially females. Dr. Jean Twenge, who authored the book iGen, explores the subject at length. While I am not ready to definitively say that social media is to blame for these rising rates depression and anxiety (correlation doesn’t always mean causation), I do believe that where there’s smoke, there’s fire. I wish it was simply a case of putting a time limit on screens and being done with it, but as parents, we really must think critically about what our kids are doing on those screens. If it came down to it, I’d much prefer 3 hours of healthy screen time to even 15 minutes of being screen captured. I’ve found that identifying the difference between screen time and screen captured has been very helpful for my family, and I hope other parents will as well. Everything I’ve learned in my role as a tech CEO, and all the research I’ve done while writing Screen Captured has reinforced the importance of taking an active role in our kids’ digital lives — no ifs, ands or buts. In our household, that means we prefer Netflix, because the algorithm isn’t as sticky as the one used by YouTube. And when we do use YouTube, all the channels are pre-vetted, and videos don’t auto-play. In our house, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook are off the table for my kids. And for that matter, the “children’s apps” that allow public posting and likes are off limits, too. Since my daughter is only eight, she won’t be signing up until we think she’s ready to understand the manipulations a little better. When she plays games online, I track all of her connections, and I try to participate with her as much as possible. We’ve even started coding mods in Minecraft together, which has been a great learning experience for her (and me!). My hope is that the distinction between screen time and screen captured will help make technology a more positive presence in every family. It’s certainly helped in my household! -- -- Founder and CEO of Kinzoo. We aspire to be the most trusted brand for incorporating technology into our children's lives. Proud husband and father of two.

It’s easy enough to understand what they do, which is create real hardware ICs (Integrated Circuits) based on your instructions. But actually figuring out how they do that, and how to program them, is quite the challenge. Mahesh Venkitachalam has been learning about FPGAs, and decided to use his new knowledge to make FPGA earrings for his wife’s birthday. Each earring is a PCB and has a Lattice iCE40UP5k FPGA chip and a 8x8 grid of SMD (Surface Mount Device) LEDs. That grid of LEDs can be used to display scrolling letters, Conway’s Game of Life, or a simple blinking pattern. The only other components on the PCBs are a CR2032 coin cell battery holder, a voltage regulator for the FPGA, an SPI flash chip to store the bitstream for the FPGA, and an oscillator for the clock. The assembled PCB earrings are a tad big and heavy, but Mahesh says they’re similar to the kinds of earrings his wife already likes to wear. To create these earrings, Mahesh enlisted the help of his friend and engineer Siva. Mahesh handled the big picture design work and programming, while Siva did the PCB design and assembly. One notable thing about the schematic is that it doesn’t include a shift register. Instead, to keep the BOM as small as possible, the LED matrix is connected directly to the FPGA’s pins. The PCB was designed as a 4-layer board in Altium Designer, along with a special pogo pin adapter for programming the FPGA. The finished earrings look fantastic, and are probably one of the most unique uses of an FPGA we’ve seen. -- -- Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg"

https://medium.com/@Telosfeed_en/worker-proposals-telos-growth-is-in-your-hands-cbf85a672535?source=tag_archive---------113-----------------------,“Worker Proposals”: Telos growth is in your hands,Written by Telos Feed,Telos Feed,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Telos Feed Follow -- Listen Share There are many differences between the features and improves of each blockchain, as, for example, time of transaction and generation of blocks, a number of tokens/cryptos in circulation, security protocols, among many others, but there are factors that add value to the networks, distinguishing one from the other. In Telos, one of these factors are the Worker Proposals (WP) and their submitting process; these proposals are presented to the community, by the community, as solutions to problems, as well as new projects that offer benefits to the network, for example, production of videos, creation of podcasts, development of marketing plans among many others. Additionally, this process allows holders of TLOS to participate actively on the decision making, concerning the funds, since there is a voting process through smart contracts where the WP may or not be accepted by the community through votes. In addition, the WPs support the Telos Foundation mission, which is to be responsible for the promotion of the adequate development of the network. Furthermore, it provides in some cases, economic support for projects that are strictly necessary and are not supported by the WP. Telos is a young blockchain and its funds for the WP are used with greater limitations, since they do not have the necessary capital to grant resources to all projects that need liquidity for their execution. It should be noted that most of the cases, that will be exposed shortly, can be financed through the WP; the Telos Foundation will fund the proposals that voters consider are not adequately financed through the WP, in addition, Telos Foundation can also request resources for the management of their own projects. Further down are some examples where Telos Foundation can support economically: • Reward to those who contributed in the launch of the network, such as, for example, Good Block, which is currently a block producer of Telos and has supported the blockchain since its origin. • Retribution to developers who worked with valuable tools used on the network. • Initial capital for the Telos Arbitration Organization (TAO), this in order to elude conflicts of interest by accepting funds from BPs, in this case it was initially funded by the Telos Foundation. If there is a case in which users have had accounts removed, they can choose to request arbitration at no cost, where TAO members have two options: the first is to assume those costs themselves and the second is to use funding from the WPs or the Telos Foundation. • Financing for the creation of new tools. • Advertising and marketing investment for the platform. • Any other function that promotes or ensures the Telos network Telos blockchain, as indicated above, grants the community the possibility of proposal registration in the network, based on a voting process, where voters can accept or reject WPs. There are several suggestions to consider, when preparing a WP. 1. The community is the- one that decides if the proposal will be approved or not, therefore, it is important to maintain a good reputation with them, since the voters have to believe in the dollar, in its team and in its concept. Being active in the social media networks, where this community participates is fundamental, one of the most important is Telegram channel named Telos Community. 2. If it is the first time submitting a WP with a larger economic scale and complexity, the suggestion is to have previously worked with the community through simple WPs with a low scale cost structure. 3. A WP is a document where a minimum of items must be specified, thus helping the community to understand more accurately the work that is going to be done. It must indicate at least to whom it is addressed (target), details of the work, the purpose, the delivery times, the work cycles that are necessary to elaborate it, the requested cost in TLOS, among other things. 4. In the WP platform, the competition among the proposals is stipulated, thus giving greater solutions to the community, and giving them the opportunity to choose for one or more WPs, creating a healthy and natural competition. 5. Submiting the proposal in several languages, gives WP an added value, since the community is not monolingual. 6. The most common file formats to save the proposals are: text (.txt), markdown (.md), html or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf), this last one is the most common, since it is the one that best preserves the IPFS format. The file size should not exceed more than 500 KB, otherwise the system will not accept it. These formats protect the file from possible modifications after registration. 7. The applicant will have to deposit a fee to submit the proposal, which represents 3% (minimum 50 TLOS) of the total amount requested for the WP, it can be claimed after having reached a number of votes. It is important to take into account that these suggestions for the preparation of a proposal, will be well received by the community, which monitors each WP through Chainspector. It is a web application created by The Telescope, an independent, non profitable Telos block producer. This web page presents a summary of live data on the Telos Blockchain network, which includes information on Worker Proposals, elections, analytics, among other things, and offers tools that users can use freely. In the section of Worker Proposals, the user can find the data of the total funds intended for WPs, the number of registered voters, and the list of WPs with their duly expressed information, for example, the voting period, the amount of TLOS requested, the work cycles, the applicant’s account, the status of the votes (number of votes in favor, against and abstention) and a link containing the description of the WP stored in IPFS. There are currently qYujuuu h 773 registered members and 18 WPs on the platform (June 26, 2019). A worker proposal should be accepted at least by 5% of the total eligible users (39 members) regardless of having 100% of acceptance in the total votes admitted. Visit the following link to get more information: https://chainspector.io The voting process is exclusively for TLOS holders, where the electors vote with the total amount of their balance of tokens, and will access the page or application enabled for this process, for example, the Sqrl wallet. Each proposal has the buttons of Yes, No and Abstention, thus the voters can exercise their right. Voters can change their decision simply by pressing another option, but they cannot eliminate their vote. The election starts when the applicant authorizes the smart contract to proceed, after it is started there is no way to cancel it, and it will culminate in the date dictated, approximately 29 days later, which represents exactly 5 million blocks The Telos community, when accepting a WP, is implying that they place their trust in the proposal and in their team to carry out the work that has been offered. This option opens many opportunities for the community, maintaining its concept of decentralization, and empowering the holders of TLOS, while promoting the execution of small and large projects that contribute to add value to the Telos Blockchain. -- -- We saw the future and it looks nuts. / Spanish account: https://medium.com/@telosfeed_es Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*eeOQX8MtColXg6SckvMzig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*eeOQX8MtColXg6SckvMzig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*eeOQX8MtColXg6SckvMzig.jpeg"
https://medium.com/unfollow-journal/what-leadership-is-missing-832df0f2b54a?source=tag_archive---------87-----------------------,What Leadership is Missing,Published in Unfollow Journal,Camilla Upson,No Author URL,N/A,9 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Camilla Upson Follow Unfollow Journal -- Listen Share An Interview with Martha Lane Fox, entrepreneur and Co-Founder of LastMinute.com, Founder of Doteverything, a technology think tank. It is now nearly twenty years since Martha Lane Fox was the Poster Girl of Web 1.0. As the co-founder of Lastminute.com with Brent Hoberman, she was one of the few internet entrepreneurs of the early noughties tech goldrush to come away with a fortune. In many ways her life has become even more interesting and eventful since then, finding herself in wide demand to work with companies in search of female talent with a knowledge of tech, she has worked on the boards of Channel 4, M&S and most recently Twitter and Chanel. In addition, she has sat since 2013 as a crossbencher in the House of Lords — she was the youngest female ever to take her seat in that place. You’re currently a non-Exec Director for two hugely contrasting companies — Twitter and Chanel — what has that taught you about leadership styles? If you had to draw comparisons from both companies — and from my own experience as well — it comes down to founders and founder culture. If you are still related to the business or in the business, which Jack [Dorsey] is at Twitter, then that determines everything. It’s impossible to underestimate the impact of that cult of founder; both good and bad. Jack is in the business, and he has a very particular style of leadership, which is to communicate all the time. He operates with radical transparency. Chanel is wrapped together by Alain [Wertheimer], the boss at the top of Chanel, who represents it very meticulously. Chanel is wildly successful — it turns over $13 billion. It is incredibly hierarchical, and yet regularly produces amazing bursts of creativity, extraordinary output, all based around a very strong sense of one individual — Coco Chanel. This is very deep-seated, despite her being long gone. I think what’s extraordinary is that every single person I’ve met at Chanel mentions Coco within the first 15 minutes of the meeting. There is an incredible preservation of the founder legacy. In both cases, I think never underestimate the power of a founder-based business. It permeates everything. So, do you have a kind of preferred mode of operating?You have to put your game face on in different situations and decide who you need to be, but fundamentally I have never had to be ‘not me’. So, I hope I retain an authenticity which links all my different ways of being. Sometimes I’m noisy, trying to be disruptive. Sometimes I’m provocative, and sometimes I will be careful, trying to work out a route through. I have never really worked for anyone else. I take very seriously being a director of a company, but you have a different kind of relationship with the business. You’re trying to be slightly on the outside. If you become too internal, then you’re not doing your job right. How are you as a boss?That is a very hard question to answer about yourself. I don’t feel like a boss, I really don’t. I feel like Doteveryone (Lane Fox is the Executive Chair of responsible technology think tank Doteveryone) is a shared endeavour with Rachel our CEO and the other people who work there. I’ve made terrible mistakes. With Lucky Voice, my karaoke business, I was trying to find myself after my accident [a serious car accident in 2004 left Martha with injuries which she must cope with for the rest of her life]. I was trying to show that I could still do everything in the business and that was ridiculous. The guy that co-founded it with me, Nick, it nearly killed him because it just wasn’t working. He was running it. I was there very temporarily (in and out) and that was not right. You have to have the confidence to help the person and be called on when they need it, not the other way around. You’re hugely in demand. What is it that organisations want from you? I’ve had a lot of luck. But overall, I think a combination of being entrepreneurial, being a woman plus being relatively provocative, and I choose that word carefully, is what they’re looking for. People think I’m an entrepreneur or a tech person and then when they talk to me, they find out that those are not necessarily the things that interest me. I am now on the joint committee for national security strategy, and I suddenly find myself very much more interested in defence and security than I ever thought I would be. Somebody described my situation the other day as like being in a not very good pop band that got some success when they were 25. It’s strange, people think that they know who you are through that. But it was 20 years ago, and I don’t think of it as my defining thing. In some ways, I am way prouder of what we did in government than at Lastminute.com. Your campaigning organisation Doteveryone has recently produced a report about internet regulation. Do you think that instead of having one all-powerful web regulator, the existing regulators should be helped and better equipped to consider the digital aspects of their work? My secret plan was to create the tools, spaces and mechanisms to dunk the political class and the public leadership of this country in more digital understanding. I’m not sure people have agreed with us. The government have said that they still want to create some form of regulation for the internet. Some of the financial regulators have had to get more savvy with the digital world than others. The ASA and some of the advertising regulation could have been better regarding technology. The dark arts of internet advertising haven’t gone away. And definitely the electoral commission need help, I would say. Everybody worth their salt in the tech world right now is saying the word ‘ethics’. It’s total virtue signalling. As long as you say ‘ethics’ and ‘morals’ then you’re home and dry, which is obviously rubbish. At Doteveryone we’ve built a decision tree and a set of processes that you can go through when you’re either starting a tech company or building a piece of software. It’s not definitive, for it to work you have to use it to reflect on what you want your own values to be, but it’s a way to try and help people. Are you optimistic about ethics and social media?Some people in tech believe you can code your way out of everything. I respect them enormously — they’ve created unbelievable tools and systems. But you’ve got to understand more about the world, about philosophy, about social perspectives, social policy, history. You can’t go on about the boundaries of free speech without understanding the broader sweep of historical context. You shouldn’t, and you can’t. It’s too important. It’s not just about employing somebody who is your chief data and ethics person and saying, ‘Tick! Job done’. During the design of a product or service, you need to consider a broader spectrum not just putting resources into the product design teams and the people that run the company (which is the way that they all run their companies at the moment). You were very important in trying to change the tone of political debate with More United (a cross-party political movement that advocates democratic reform and co-operation with the EU, among other things). And you are continuing. What made you want to do something with them?It was very simple. I felt like enough people (not everybody) were very upset by the result of the Brexit referendum because it did not feel fair. I did not feel it had been regulated properly and I still think that. The people who are nominally in charge of making those decisions don’t understand technology and its impacts. The tech sector post-Brexit immediately came together to demand the things they wanted. What about thinking about what the tech sector can bring to the country after what’s happened? What about standing up and saying, ‘hold on a minute’? Many have come out now, but not enough, in my humble opinion. None are saying what they believe in. I feel that is extraordinary, interesting and unacceptable. It’s always the same old voices and faces speaking up. I find that as disappointing as the polarisation — I don’t know how the debate has become so petty and so uninformed. Clearly, we are not addressing the real reasons that people feel the way they do. We are just continuing without knowing the fundamentals and it’s only going to get worse. I was speaking in the House of Lords recently and talking about a famous wildlife clip that was going around on Twitter of two deer fighting in the foreground and then a huge lion comes along, stalks them, they don’t see it, and he comes up behind them and jumps and kills one. This is how I feel about the climate. I feel like we are all squabbling about our future relationships with a bunch of countries and it is not irrelevant, but in the grand scheme of things we should be focusing our attention and our brains on climate change. I’m an optimistic person but I do feel that we have a responsibility to be sceptical. It sounds like it was politics not business you should have gone for from the start. When I was 15 I wanted to go into politics. It was strange that I became an entrepreneur, I don’t naturally feel at home in business. And I am not doing a classic female thing, I am not trying to be false-humble, I can do it, but it’s not what makes me tick. At Lastminute.com we had to convince suppliers to give us things and people to buy our products, but doing something in government, you have to convince all of the political class, all the civil service class, and then people to come and work with you, so that felt very entrepreneurial. Being in the House of Lords on the cross benches is also very entrepreneurial because you don’t have any party support. You don’t get told what to do, you’re not whipped. So, you have to have confidence to bring something from the outside. So, at 15 what did you want to do in politics?I wanted to be an MP, I wanted to be prime minister. I wanted to make MGM musicals from the 1950s part of the national curriculum. I wanted to ban all prisons. And fundamentally, I wanted a big dose of gender equality. Nothing to do with technology, that was completely off my radar. But in all seriousness, when I left Lastminute.com I did think that I could try and be Mayor of London. You could still do that. No, the accident has put paid to all of that. I physically don’t have the stamina. I’m still tempted, to be honest. I feel like especially now it’s important that women who have a voice use it, so I try to use my voice. I was speaking at a conference about defence recently and I was the only female speaker. I spoke about my experience of how you build resilience. That it’s important. Then I sat down and said to the guy next to me, ‘It’s a bit dispiriting that I’m the only woman talking about this’ and he looked at me and he said ‘Well, it’s not a very girly subject’. I was really flummoxed. I didn’t know what to say to him, which is not often the case. We just need a lot more women in public life, full stop. In everything, in fact. There is a long way to go and if you look at the tech sector it’s getting worse, not better. I encourage young women or any women to not be scared of being a generalist, of course being a deeply committed biochemist is brilliant, but you can also be like me. I’m interested in defence as much as karaoke and that’s fine. You can always bring things from one to the other. That is what we try to do at DotEveryone as well, not to be too siloed. So what advice would you give to your 15-year-old self now? Don’t be scared or feel insecure about not being in a box. There are so many people now saying to women particularly, use your voice, which is great. That is only a small bit of it though. The rest of it is about finding your voice, how you use it, making sure that you’re making a contribution. What else would I tell my 15-year-old self? Probably wear your seatbelt, to be honest.

The giant battery inside the frame also doesn’t change the phone’s appearance to big. It is seen from the thickness of the device that is classified as thin (9, 1mm). The camera settings on the back panel are also not prominent which will usually add to the device thickness. But Oppo protects the camera by placing a circular frame around the lens that protects the camera from scratches when placed on a table. Switching to the sides, on the left wing of the device is a volume rocker and SIM card tray. While on the opposite wing, there is only one multi-function button (Power On/OFF, as well as a lock screen locker and opener). While the upper side, the device appears plontos without ornaments. Regarding the SIM Card slot, Oppo A9 (2020) provides three slots in one tray. So users can activate two SIMS (mini SIM) and insert a microSD card at once. Screen One of the ideal smartphone requirements for content connoisseurs is that the screen must be super wide. Well, Oppo A9 (2020) features the Sunlight Screen panel with an area of 6.5 inches of HD + resolution with a ratio of 20:9. Sunlight Screen delivers real color on the screen when used in less light environments. A9 (2020) will also automatically activate the blue light filter to protect the user’s eyes from the freedom and eye damage. In the upper part of the screen, there is a minimalist, water drop shaped bangs, where the 16MP selfie camera has been injected with AI Beautification. Selfie camera can identify skin color, skin type, age, and gender. In addition, users can also capture both monochrome and bokeh images directly from the front camera. Performance The performance of Oppo A9 (2020) is ensured smoother than in previous series A models. The reason is that the phone is the first A series to use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 6 series. The Snapdragon 665 Chipset was built with a 64-bit 8-core processor, consisting of 4-core Cortex-A73 and 4-core Cortex-A53. Coupled with 8GB RAM LPDDR4x and 128GB UFS 2.1 storage, so surely users will feel smoothly when multi-tasking on smartphones, even play heavy games though. What’s more, storage can be exported through a microSD card up to 256GB. That combination led to the performance of Oppo A9 (2020) better than the previous models. More detailed, this latest chipset consumes a lower energy consumption of 20% with 2x AI performance better than the Snapdragon 660. And when compared to the Snapdragon 450, Oppo A9 (2020) increased 40% and the GPU increased BatteryFor creators and connoisseurs of content, the large battery in smartphones is a mandatory requirement. As the ideal smartphone for content connoisseurs, the Oppo A9 (2020) is equipped with a giant battery capacity of 5,000 mAh. Thus, the phone is sure to survive a full day in normal use. In enjoying video content, the phone can last more than 19 hours. In addition to the giant battery, Oppo A9 (2020) is also equipped with USB Type C to charge and has been carrying Reverse Charging feature by utilizing OTG feature. This means that your phone can play like a powerbank to charge other devices. Camera In creating content, the Oppo A9 (2020) is equipped with four cameras at once on the rear panel. Three of them are arranged vertically. While the fourth camera is positioned just below the LED Flash. The main camera 48MP Oppo A9 (2020) uses an Isocell GM1 lens with an aperture of f/1.8. The second camera to take ultra-wide photos using an Omnivision lens and the bottom one is the 2MP f/2.4 monochromatic lens. The last camera under Flash is a 2MP Portrait lens with an aperture of f/2.4. The 48MP camera comes in high resolution, making users can take pictures with more detai and clearer results. Wide-angle lenses offer a 119 ° shooting angle to facilitate expansive images in confined spaces. Monochromatic lenses and portrait lenses allow users to get retro camera results for portrait photos, offering more personalized results. Plus, Oppo has injected the latest features and filters in mobile photography, ranging from bokeh effect, monochrome, wide angle, panorama, professional, to Ultra Night Mode 2.0. The Ultra Night Mode 2.0 comes with the best noise reduction for nighttime photos. As a result, HDR features and multi-frame technology on Ultra Night Mode 2.0 can produce night photos with high brightness. The latest, Ultra Night Mode 2.0 can be used on wide-angle lenses. Not forgetting the Oppo A9 camera (2020) has also been injected with AI so that it can help users to choose the appropriate mode in photographing certain scenes. Also, it’s a handy feature to detect environments or get to know the highlighted objects. Oppo A9 (2020) can capture 4K quality video smoothly (minimal shock) thanks to the feature of Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) for video stability. If you’re afraid of full fast memory, the vendors also provide 1080p and 720p quality video recording options. Not forgetting popular features like Time Lapse and Slow Mo are also available. Game Boost 2.0 For gaming experience, the Game Boost 2.0 Accelerator technology offers improved technology with Frame Boost and Touch Boost features.

https://medium.com/building-blocks-on-the-chain/make-recursion-easy-ab031489d3d?source=tag_archive---------61-----------------------,Keep Recursion Simple,Published in ChainShot,Dan Nolan,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Dan Nolan Follow ChainShot -- Listen Share Break it down to the base case! A function that calls itself, that calls itself, that calls itself… Recursion can be a tricky concept to wrap your brain around! 😵 Many people choose a difficult problem as their first attempt at recursion. Often the problem involves advanced data structures like trees. In many ways, this makes sense! These are the types of problems that recursion can make simpler. Recursion is best at solving problems where you can sub-divide it into smaller problems. My advice is to start by doing the opposite. At least while learning recursion, attempt to solve the simple problems first. Take a problem you would normally solve iteratively and attempt to solve it with recursion. It will be tough at first! With enough practice you’ll learn to recognize situations where recursion can help and you’ll be able to apply your new skills. If you can handle coding loops, you are capable of learning recursion! Take a while loop: In this loop we execute the body block while the condition is true. Rather than a condition to keep running, recursive algorithms reach a point to stop and return. This point is commonly referred to as the base case. Let’s take an example. Imagine we are counting squares. Start from the top with a count of zero and count one square at a time: Picture each rectangle above as a call to a function. We execute the Body with new Arguments until we reach our Base Case. At that point we return our final count, 3. When you’re writing a recursive solution, keep two things in mind: Let’s think of another simple problem that is normally solved iteratively: summing an array of numbers. Solving this iteratively is a cinch! What if we wanted to solve this recursively? Let’s start with numbers [1,2,3] and a sum 0. A good first step would be to think ahead to our base case. How do we know when to stop? One solution is to remove an element from the array each time we recurse. That way, when the array is empty we know it’s time to stop and return the sum. Each time we remove the element we can add it to the sum, so we accumulate the total by the end of the recursion! What would this look like as a JavaScript function? Each time the function calls itself, it is added to the call stack. The call stack keeps track of where we are in the program so it knows where to return. Starting from the first function call, the call stack would look like this: Notice how the arguments change each time we call total. The numbers are changing towards an empty array, while the sum is accumulating. Each call to total returns the result of the function call inside it, resulting in the final sum being returned all the way up the stack. Be mindful that pop modifies the original array! Any part of the program holding a reference to the array can be affected. Now, this isn’t the only solution to solve this problem recursively. Another solution would be to keep an index. This actually works out pretty similar to a loop: In this case, we don’t modify our array numbers. We increment the index instead. We use that index to read numbers from the array and add them the sum. Once the index reaches the length of the array we return the sum all the way back up the call stack. See the difference? We’re not modifying the array each time. We’re modifying the index instead. Just like a loop condition, your base case can be anything you choose it to be! Finally, I’ll provide one more solution: This solution is a bit trickier. Instead of accumulating the sum and passing it down the call stack, we’re adding the number to the return value of each recursive call. Neat, huh? Ready for Recursion Code Challenges?

https://medium.com/motion-forward/a-short-reflection-on-future-fear-46e1b3824c03?source=tag_archive---------137-----------------------,A short reflection on “future fear”,Written by Zephyr Penoyre,Zephyr Penoyre,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Zephyr Penoyre Follow -- Listen Share Don’t stand in the doorway. Don’t block up the hall. — Bob Dylan We all suffer from future fear: every time we’re trained to associate the name of a company, individual or even piece of technology with an emotion that’s playing into and playing on a nebulous fear of the unknown. It can make us hate the modern world, just as any abusable and jingoistic emotion can. There are many immediate and long term effects and forces worth an emotion like fear, and many of those are associated with our ever-expanding, all-consuming and hyperconnected world. But a nebulous fear of the future pervades the modern conversation about technology— a word in italics because technology is a bad name for an inevitable shift towards a different and better world (for who you ask? the people with the technology — and the good news is that has the capacity to be everyone) Future fear is not the way to prevent the world we fear developing, it’s the way to ensure it has the chance to. Because future fear is irrational, and irrational fear blinds us. It prevents us from asking rational questions and listening to rational answers. Do you ever wonder what major doctrinal schools future scholars will say the people of today debated and were swayed by? I believe it will be sonderism vs. tribalism. If you wish to live in a world where people are segregated and led, for the betterment of some and at the cost of others, feel free to keep your nebulous fears. If you wish to live in a world where each person believes that the well being of the other people around them contributes to their happiness more than it costs, I encourage you to break down your future fear. It’s not that you’re wrong to have fears, there's some scary stuff out there. Mass communication and a global economy are the most abusable tool ever created. The richest and most powerful people in the world are also the richest and most powerful in history, and that is set to continue. Our rights are being parcelled off and sold for a (miniscule) profit. We making deals with the devil without ever having read the deal or seen the devil. There are institutionalized misbalances in the current political and economic realities that hurt all of us and exploit many of us. But each of these problems is singular. It is understandable. It is eminently preventable, and preventing it doesn’t pose any threat to the quality of our lives. We can have a private and a safe internet. We can have global access to a basic (actually pretty good) standard of living. I hope to have a platform to talk about each in turn. But I promised a brief thought here, so I’ll save righting the wrongs of the world for another essay. There are specific questions we need to be asking, of ourselves, politics, science and commerce. Some of those questions we know. Some we don’t. They are all simple questions. But that doesn’t mean they’re easy. Future fear is debilitating. It keeps you from asking those questions. Good and bad are fairytales. New paradigms of thought and technology don’t have a morality. They are the complex sum of many simple parts — some are positive, some negative. If we ever fall in the trap of painting them with a broad brush we lose the ability to actually adrees the negatives and promote the positives. In fact, basic human nature will likely lead us to see them as negative. You’re right that the modern world can seem to be moving in ways you don’t understand. It’s not because it’s impossibly complex, you were just never taught it. And when you’ve heard about it it’s probably been via people in whose interest it is to make it seem complex — be they academics, corporations or news outlets. Game theory isn’t a complex mathematical beast, it’s a pragmatic and universally effective way to understand sociology and economics. Machine intelligence is neither a far off dream nor a complex subject. We’re not slowly having our freedoms stripped away by some grand architect of destiny, we’re just careening unknowingly into a future that we’re too scared to break down into simple rational questions. There’s no compelling reason why the future of humanity will not be a (pragmatic) utopia. There is a big reason though, and that’s the self-imposed blindness of fear. Postscript There’s clearly more to write on a subject like this. I’m not sure there has ever been such a disconnect between our net understanding of the world and the level that has percolated down to individuals, even those actively seeking knowledge. (n.b. I don’t believe any unanswerable questions remain in science — an incredible achievement that many are understandably cautious to recognize — a marvelous thought for another time) Fear is a visceral reaction, and many who read this may experience any number of strong emotions. Talk to others, and to yourselves about it. Don’t be afraid to reach out (my twitter is full of jokes for my own benefit but not a bad way to contact me). I encourage you to not let anyone, I included, tell what to fear. The role of a teacher is to make others aware of a concept, not to enforce it. Try your best not to inherit opinions — make sure you’re spreading your own views and not what someone has told you. Accept that we will always be swayed by the thoughts of others, it is creative to have new thoughts, but also to recombine old ones. And the wonder of being creative in thought is that the cost is low, even if you get it wrong, it only costs a little pride to admit to a mistake, it costs much more to commit to one. I don’t want to shame anyone for feeling fear. I just want to spread the good news that this too shall pass. -- -- .

This is not an event to be missed, with nearly $1 million USD of AGR tokens to be won through our signature Token Death Match 5 minute multiplayer games. Read more below and make sure you have joined our social and community channels to find out about the upcoming, world’s first Gamedrop™and many more thereafter! After 6 months of development CoinFabric, a subsidiary of Blockchain.inc (a Blockchain Consultancy and partnership network), has officially launched the first of its kind Gamedrop™ platform, Agareum, as one of the first ventures to launch out of their venture and incubation studio BlockchainXYZ. Airdrops have been an industry standard, and an extremely popular service, used by many crypto and blockchain enabled businesses over the past couple of years. An Airdrop is when a company or project allocates a portion of its total token supply toward their marketing efforts to fuel rapid community growth and awareness of their project. Airdrops also allow for a broad distribution of tokens to ensure an ecosystem remains diverse, as well as incentivizes individuals to assist with distribution and sharing of the project’s posts and content throughout their marketing campaigns. Although an effective tactic used for new blockchain and crypto projects, the airdrop model as been primed for Dean Cannell, Blockchain.inc Founder and General partner at BlockchainXYZ, went on to say: “Granted Airdrops have provided a lot of growth for projects in this space, but the previous offering has left quite a bit to be desired from an engagement perspective. Our goal is to service both stakeholders — projects and bounty hunters — with a brand new, and more engaging approach.“ A Gamedrop™, or gamified Airdrop, takes the concept of an airdrop one step further. The process of creating true and authentic community members is based on their commitment to go that extra mile. Creating a multiplayer space for individuals to play competitively for tokens, as opposed to merely signing up, is an extremely impactful tactic for creating longer lasting impressions on community members — and ensuring a successful campaign. BlockchainXYZ have essentially created a two-sided online multiplayer marketplace between projects and bounty hunters, where projects are able to expand their communities in a fun and engaging manner, while community members are provided an addictive and appealing gaming environment where they are able to play against each other head-to-head, and collect the tokens provided by these projects during actual game play.” The first multiplayer game to utilize the Gamedrop™ technology is Agareum. The Agareum game itself is based on a traditional game but the platform itself plays host to a plethora of additional features such as Ethereum Wallet integration (ERC20), crypto-oriented player skins, and the ability to pick up / collect tokens within the game which can be used to gain access to additional features and later be transferred to exchanges for trading. On the 2nd of September 2019 the first ever official Gamedrop™ will be launched, using Agareum’s utility token AGR. AGR will play a significant role throughout the Agareum ecosystem, including access to future game features and staking for access to third-party project Gamedrops™. Casual gaming has been honoring a rather bullish trajectory over the recent years, and although blockchain gaming has yet to enter the mainstream market, there is a gap for brands and projects to connect and engage with consumers in a fun and competitive environment. BlockchainXYZ have recently completed their Agareum test phase, with Dean Cannell reporting back stating that: “It could not have gone any better. Thousands of people from around the world took part in the testing phase providing invaluable feedback and suggestions. As a community-first platform it was great to receive such genuine interest, and this confirms the direction as a medium of engagement for brands and bounty hunters (or gamers) to connect for real value exchange.” There are loads of exciting announcements and community driven initiatives lined up for 2019 and beyond, with new Gamedrops™, modes, and features to be rolled out on a monthly basis. Visit Agareum to get involved and join the world of crypto rewards though casual gaming. Happy gaming!

https://medium.com/pynk/frontier-tech-in-food-supply-chains-6dd8ad71958?source=tag_archive---------93-----------------------,Frontier Tech in Food Supply Chains,Published in Pynk,Mark L,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Mark L Follow Pynk -- Listen Share Mark L | CMO/Co-founder You may have read our recent article from Philip Fletcher, Pynk Product Director, on how new technologies are working in unison, rather than in isolation. Too often we see evangelists hyping the technology of their chosen field with claims of solving world problems. However, it is rarely the case that a single technology works in isolation of others. In this article, I will cover examples of how frontier technologies will be used together to create more efficient and transparent Supply Chains in the food and beverage industries. In a world where the global population has almost doubled in the last 50 years to a staggering 7.7 billion people, technology solutions such as these will have an increasingly important role to play. Let us first start with what we mean by Frontier Tech of which there are typically 5 core areas: AI (incl. Machine and Deep Learning), IoT, Drones, Artificial, Augmented and Virtual reality, and Blockchain. In addition to these, there are some future tech fields that are some years away from mainstream adoption but worth noting — such as Bioinformatics, Nanotech, Space, Robotics, Unmanned vehicles/Autonomous Driving and Quantum computing. Having worked in the food and beverages industry for some years, my interest in these technologies was piqued when I read about how supply chains could be recorded in an immutable ledger. There are numerous blockchain startups building commercial models around exactly this, including Provenance, SkuChain, EverLedger and BlockVerify to name but a few. Of these, @Sunny Lu’s (CEO VeChain) recent announcement of ToolChain has been causing most excitement, and promises the potential for commercial scale-ability. ToolChain offers business owners a turn key solution with the hardware, software and service protocols needed to onboard an end to end supply chain to the VeChainThor blockchain within 30 minutes. Bext 360 is a personal favourite of mine. Daniel Jones, CEO and founder, started his career in the diamond industry and has intimate knowledge of a machine that scanned diamonds for weight and clarity immediately after mining. Today, Bext360's robot scans coffee cherries straight after harvesting and uses machine learning to evaluate them into grades based on size and quality. The data collected from these scanners is recorded directly onto the Stellar blockchain. It’s well documented that Coffee farmers around the world remain impoverished despite the dramatic growth the Coffee industry has enjoyed, both in volume and value terms, over the last 20 years. To understand the industry dynamics better, read Oxfam report Mugged Off and you start to understand the horrible irony when watching wealthy westerners enjoy their daily coffee (or 6 in my case!), oblivious to the fact that coffee cherry farmers around the world are living in abject poverty. For those coffee growers on the wrong end of the value chain — the Bext 360 model offers the potential for more ‘value per cup’ to be returned to those who need it most. Since the cherries are scanned at source for size and weight, farmers are rewarded fairly for the fruits of their labour (literally) and are incentivised to produce the best quality beans. These incentives are arguably removed in farmer co-ops. Secondly, the cherries are recorded at every stage of the supply chain from farm to cup. That means scanning an RFID (or other IoT techniques) at point of consumption allows the end consumer to see data on who picked the beans, complete transparency in how much they were paid, and allows them to tip the farmer directly with crypto token payments. When it comes to purposing an immutable ledger for Supply Chain purposes, the elephant in the room has always been how to stop corruption along the way. What’s to stop a bad actor from replacing the original food product with lower quality or counterfeit product along the way? This is where recent developments in food scanning technology come into play. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has changed the playing field and, thanks to ultra-high throughput, scalability, and speed, NGS could enable those in food supply chains to scan food products, read DNA and ensure authenticity. While similar technologies have existed for many years, NGS promises to be the first that can be commercially viable and used outside of the laboratory. For more on NGS, see this article on what the team at Tech Labs, Portugal are working on. Drones, technically known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), are another of these Frontier techs that are increasingly becoming common place in agriculture. Their benefits are numerous — but at the core of what they offer farmers is efficient and cost effective data collection. Real time information can quickly be collected on crops, yields, weather, and other environmental and infrastructure factors. When managing industrial scale farms, Drones are the go-to technology for data collection. And once the data is collected, AI will play a crucial role in Agri Tech. AI has long been used by the world’s biggest food companies in demand planning, and works incredibly well since it continuously monitors accuracy and are built around learning feedback loops. Dr. Solomon Assefa, Vice President at IBM research labs in Kenya and South Africa, reports the company is using AI to accurately predict crop yields in specific regions, taking account for factors such as weather patterns, soil moisture and other conditions. He is also leading on ‘nanophotonics technology’ and ‘high-speed optical detectors, nano-structured platforms for bio-sensing, and quantum information processing’. For more on the ground breaking work at IBM research labs see here. The above summarises just a few examples of how Frontier Techs will be used to drive transparency and efficiencies in food supply chains and how tech can be used for good. Here at Pynk we support those technologies that help achieve this.

https://blog.bitsrc.io/develop-your-own-background-manager-3b68f139e24e?source=tag_archive---------58-----------------------,Develop Your Own Background Manager,Build a desktop background manager with Nodejs and Unsplash API,Daniel Gospodinow,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Daniel Gospodinow Follow Bits and Pieces -- Listen Share Okay, so the idea is to build a simple cross-platform software utility that changes your desktop background image on a regular basis. It would be nice if we have control over the size of images (e.g. 1920x1080, etc) and the kind of images that are put on our desktop (e.g. cats, dogs, nature, nice-looking girls, etc). Further things that need to be considered are the configurable setup of the time interval over which the background wallpaper will be changed, the kind of strategy for image storage and image storage maintenance. For image resources, we’ll use the Unsplash API, which is also used by our beloved Medium. This API is wonderful because it offers us an outstanding set of high-quality images that are free to use. Additionally, it has an intuitive and easy to use interface. Okay, so here’s the basic logic for our application — “Download an image and store it in a folder which is properly maintained. Afterward, set the newly downloaded image as a desktop background. Repeat that on a regular schedule.” We’ll do it in five steps. Yes, the order of the steps really matters! We’ll need to have a folder in which we’ll store our images. Let’s make it happen with the help of the build-in fs module! We also need to ensure the folder’s existence in case someone deletes it without our acknowledgment. This can be done easily if we just run this function every time before executing one of the steps that follow up next. In order to prevent too many disk usage, we will clean up some images when a certain folder capacity is reached. The capacity limit should be somehow balanced in order to prevent the folder from taking too much space and to also make sure that if a user likes a certain desktop wallpaper he can go in that storage folder and save it for further use. This task can also be accomplished with the help of the build-in fs module. For example, a folder capacity of size 10 is kind of okay. This means that all the time there will be a maximum of 10 images, so when an 11th image comes in for storage, one of the 10 will be removed in order to make space for the new one. So next, we need a mechanism for downloading images and setting them as desktop background wallpapers. First, we need to get a link from which we can download a wallpaper. Here the Unsplash API comes into play. We’ll use this https://source.unsplash.com/featured/ endpoint to collect new images from the Unsplash website. With an HTTP GET request and the fetch module for Nodejs, we’ll collect a new wallpaper URL from that endpoint. Secondly, let’s search for a Nodejs image download mechanism in Google. After a quick “nodejs donwload image” search, we see that Google is judging us for the typing mistake that we’ve made. After fixing the error and searching again, we find the Node Image Downloader module for downloading images from a given URL. Okay, now that we have everything needed to change the desktop background, we can easily do it as it follows: The imageResolution function parameter defines the wanted resolution of the image which the Unsplash API should return to us, whereas the imageCategories function parameter tells the API what kind of images to return to us. The function is an async function in order to use the async/await mechanism for handling JavaScript promises. Okay, now that we’ve got this working, let’s move on. Now the last thing that we need to do is to repeat the whole process over and over. We have two mechanisms with which we can accomplish this: We’ll use the latter approach because it provides wider functionality and the code looks more beautiful with it. So at last, we just chain together, one after another, the three functions that take care of our app’s logic. The first argument in the scheduleJob() function represents a cron expression, which basically defines the interval over which the function will be executed. In our case, the “0 * * * *” cron expression instructs an execution of the function, provided as a second argument, at every round hour. For this to work, we need to make sure the functions in the previous steps are made async. The application is ready! The only thing that’s left to be done is the merging of all the development parts together, but there’s no need for that because I’ll directly provide the source code for you down below and also at GitHub. Note that in order to run the snippet above, you’ll need to be familiar with the process of running Nodejs applications. If you aren’t, just download the sources from GitHub and follow these instructions. Here you go! You just found out how you can develop your own desktop background manager. And yeah, Nodejs is a famous, wonderful, and powerful tool with which software applications are just a pleasure to make.

Answer: purchase a domain name first and foremost. Then reserve a dedicated web hosting package. Third, install WordPress as your blogging CMS content management solution on your dedicated hosting package. Fourth, pick a niche topic you like talking about. Fifth, get in the mindset of creating longform content in excess of 1500 words or more Monday through Friday for the next 2 to 3 years. Blogging your thoughts to the Internet will allow you to partner with relevant online advertisers and promote affiliated advertisements on your blog and efforts of potentially making money online 24 hours a day. This is by far the easiest way to make money from home as a “stay-at-home blogging mother.” If you’re consistent with your blogging and do it for 2 to 3 years in excess of 1500 words or more, you’ll never have to work a day job ever again in life. Google AdSense and affiliate networks paid handsome affiliate commissions to bloggers who have high quality traffic coming to their blogs and convert sales on their blogs easily. This can be you if you get in the mindset today of dedicating yourself to being a “work from home side hustle blogger.” Believe it or not, you can achieve “side hustle millionaire” status from “affiliate marketing and blogging” alone and become and “online millionaire” by “working from home through blogging.” But this has to be a line of work you truly want to do because truth is, there’s no guarantee of financial success. You must be willing to continually move forward on days when you don’t make money online. You must have a long-term visionary mindset and look to the future because, you won’t be earning $10,000 a month in your first year as a “work from home mommy blogger.” If you feel you have the business muscle for the hustle as an “stay-at-home mommy blogger,” try your hand today at “blogging and affiliate marketing working from home.” -- -- Affiliate links are included in all articles.

https://medium.com/swlh/sacramento-shows-silicon-valley-whos-boss-f0c5a9bb67b9?source=tag_archive---------31-----------------------,Sacramento shows Silicon Valley who’s boss,Published in The Startup,J.J. Stranko,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in J.J. Stranko Follow The Startup -- Listen Share Today, California passed the most sweeping and most damaging legislation to the gig economy that the United States has produced, and potentially the biggest challenge to Silicon Valley that any legislature anywhere has ever approved. The legislature in Sacramento could have let stand a 2018 California Supreme Court ruling establishing many of the same provisions that the legislation created. Instead, it decided to make a strong statement against the market power of hometown heroes like Uber and Lyft, and give state houses around the country both the air cover and the blueprint to enact legislation of their own. Both the Assembly and Governor Gavin Newsom are expected to endorse the bill. Two truths and a lie The business model of the gig economy was built on two truths and a lie. The first truth was that services could be delivered more cheaply and more nimbly through a vast network of contractors enabled by smart tech tools. The second truth was that consumers would pick up some of the slack in their compensation model through the good old American habit of tipping. The lie, however, was that gig economy workers, enabled to live their best lives through setting their own schedules and controlling their hours, would earn so much money so flexibly that they would forget that they received no benefits and no job security. Put together, companies like Uber and Lyft assumed that masses of happy consumers, now spoiled for convenience and choice and unwilling to go back to their old ways, would shield companies against government intervention. Long a laboratory and guinea pig for Silicon Valley’s innovations, California’s statement is not just an reactionary ploy from an angry government. Instead, it reflects a fundamental challenge to the consumer-led assumptions of Silicon Valley’s growth. If the winners of the new conveniences created by tech disruption (consumers) can’t be counted on to defend innovation against the losers (organized labor, low-wage workers), the gig economy model will quickly run out of steam. California sails when Washington flails Rumblings of the imbalances in this model, which naturally stacks the deck in favor of the employer, came up cross the world in the past several years. In Paris and Barcelona, taxi drivers rioted as rule-breakers like Uber bulldozed their regulated livelihoods. In New York, yellow cab drivers began committing suicide because of the debts caused by their crashing taxi license investments. In London, rideshare services were suspended by the Mayor’s office while the government assessed the employment status of gig workers (it’s now before the UK Supreme Court). Some government bodies in Europe responded with regulation, some governments like New York State’s fought back through licensing and taxation. But California’s legislature did something different today, and something more far reaching than many of us are likely to understand for some time. And what they did reflects damning fundamental trends for the entire gig economy. Unlike European governments and New York State, California has a long-standing market power to create national policies through its state decisions. And in a climate where Washington’s priorities seem to be on another planet from Sacramento’s priorities, the state is learning how to wield that weapon again. From vehicle emissions standards to drug prices and consumer privacy, California’s sheer size allows it to force companies operating nationwide to choose between adjusting American compliance standards down to state level (perplexing), or complying to California’s higher demands for the entire American market (expensive). Few good moves for companies like Uber and Lyft Gig economy companies’ next move will likely be to raise prices to show consumers how it can use its market power. But states’ next move will likely be to emulate California’s legislation to regulate workers’ rights, potentially opening up dozens of legal and lobbying fronts for companies at a time when their solvency is in question. It also means established companies and start-ups struggling to win over consumers will be simultaneously fighting very public battles to limit worker rights, not a good look. That reality would make a meaningful shift away from a gig economy employment model, to a more traditional employment model, the only feasible way for companies like Uber and Lyft to keep building their businesses. California can take a lot of the blame for enabling the messy realities of the gig economy, but California also deserves credit for starting to clean it up. -- -- Get smarter at building your thing.

We hosted an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session in our Aergo Official Telegram group with Phil Zamani (Chairman and CEO), and Kyle Owens (Community Lead)",Aergo,No Author URL,N/A,27 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Aergo Follow Aergo blog -- Listen Share Phil Zamani — Introduction WELCOME TO OUR SECOND AMA OF 2019 Hello everybody! This is Phil Zamani, CEO and Chairman at Aergo. I am happy to announce the beginning of our second Telegram AMA session of the year. Our team has been working hard over the past few weeks since our last AMA — which took place about six weeks ago — on delivering on our technology, building out our ecosystem, getting clients on board, and much more. From going through even more rigorous optimization and improvement process to build and transition our testnet into a mainnet (https://bit.ly/2Gdcdy7) — to adding on cool new functionalities, enhancing its existing features, and putting these together into new versions and more test networks (https://bit.ly/2S9fi4J). You can check out the team’s progress in real-time on our GitHub. Yes, we’ve been working hard on our continuing to deliver our tech! Our R&D team is working swiftly to engineer our mainnet — to make it a very hi quality release — just as we managed to ship out a fully-functional testnet for our network in just around six months. This is the benefit of having a highly skilled, wonderful, well-coordinated development team (and great leadership behind them!). Our ecosystem expansion and growth efforts have been fruitful. Our teams have been working hard on building out two of the applications that we’re developing in house to run on top of Aergo. In case you missed it, Won (Blocko founder and CEO) stepped into the Telegram chat (https://t.me/aergoofficial/99311) and gave some great and insightful information on what this stuff we’re working on actually is! Our teams attended a couple events to showcase them, namely the Korea Blockchain Game Show 2019 (https://bit.ly/2T2CaqT) which featured some of the physical items that will be a part of some of the apps. Of course, in Korea our team has been closing many deals. I talked about one of them on the media and many are being actively reported on Korean media if you keep track of things. The results of our work with the Bank of Korea were published, our work with the Jeju province (https://bit.ly/2SLuJVG) in implementing blockchain-based land registry transaction notarizations involving governments and banks evolved into a potential full-scale implementation that could involve our public chain, and we recently began working with Hyundai Glovis on blockchain-based automotive life management (https://bit.ly/2SNRoAU). Most of the stuff we’re working on however, by nature, cannot be shared until a later time. These are projects with major enterprise clients — who like before — will talk about their success with Aergo and Blocko when the time is right (37 delivered production level projects and counting…). There is a lot going on though the majority of it we can’t discuss (yet). This includes deals we’re cooking up for native Aergo-based deployments, enterprise and academic partnerships that we’ll be happy to share information on at a later time. If you haven’t yet heard, we partnered with SatoshiPay just the other day (https://bit.ly/2SUvHyk). This partnership is quite significant. We’re proud to be one of the few projects in this space carving out real partnerships — not just marketing hype! We plan to integrate SatoshiPay with the Aergo mainnet as well as with the Aergo service layer. This effectively means micropayments for content paywalls and IoT would be settled on our architecture using their amazing technology. It also means the Hub and Marketplace would have a fiat credit-card payment option for ease of use in building solutions for enterprise customers, in addition to that same option being available for dApp developers to create frictionless experiences for new users of their Lua + SQL-based applications. We’re open to any questions in this AMA. We aim to maintain a transparent and honest community relationship here. Therefore, we welcome our community to be both very direct — but also respectful that there are certain items we simply cannot comment on. We do however want to remind everyone to read and follow our Quarterly Project Update from last month (https://bit.ly/2GSRnEH) to stay updated on some items such as financials and liquidity. All matters related to liquidity, token metrics and commercial investments Aergo is making will be communicated through these quarterly project updates (QPUs). Please understand that during the AMA there may be some topics that I cannot directly discuss, however I will try my best (as always) to answer as many questions as is possible. I want to remind everyone that we are actively listening to the community on questions they raise in our Telegram channel even outside of sessions like this. We also plan to start using some cool new techniques to better engage with our community very soon (watch this space!). As we near our mainnet release, you will increasingly see more focus on our developer, integrator, ecosystem partners and customers. We have amazing technology to ship — but without an active and vibrant partner network it will not reach its maximum potential…more on this soon! We intend to host these AMAs about every six weeks from hereon. This should make sure we get to address any questions our community has as our project evolves and grows. Today’s AMA begins now. I will be online for an hour and answer questions raised in this time frame. Please begin by asking your questions in a respectful manner below! Question 1 Hi to all, Phil agree with me. Success triangle in stake market is = Hard work+best partner+best marketing). You dedicate hard work and are one of the best partners. But you you do not have the best marketing. Aergo is great project but Aergo is only added to small exchanges. In the end, what have you planed for adding Aergo to a big and famous exchange? Phil — We understand the need to have Aergo listed on hi quality exchanges and have good liquidity — I can assure our community that much is going on that we simply cannot share before it happens — please bear with us and watch this space! — Question 2 Have you planned to add Aergo to a big and famous exchange? Phil — We understand the need to have Aergo listed on hi quality exchanges and have good liquidity — I can assure our community that much is going on that we simply cannot share before it happens — please bear with us and watch this space! — Question 3 How are you addressing new exchanges and the increase in circulating supply which will happen in march? With the lack of liquidity in existing markets. Phil — See above answer — In short we are working on it 😊 — Question 4 Any plans for SEA (Ie community wise)? Kyle — Of course. Korea is actually one of our key target regions and where Aergo is most prominent. This is due to Blocko’s strong presence in the area and majority market share in the blockchain scene. China is also a target region! But Not at this time. We’ll put a focus there as we expand, into 2020. China, Korea, UK (aka global), Germany. Those are our targets for 2019. — Question 5 Are you guys competing with ICON/ICONLOOP; and how dominant is Aergo/BLOCKO compared to them in Korea? Phil — This needs a detailed answer..so pls bear with me…. Blocko and Aergo work with national government agencies. The projects and the notions behind them are VERY LARGE. We focus on using blockchain for the core working areas where much more complicated and complex structural models are required: land registry, payment settlements and so on. The way to think about this is we have lost of real competition in PoCs but few are able to deliver the scale and complexity of production level deployments like Aergo through Blocko! — Question 6 Why will company using Aergo will buy the token? — What drives the demand? Phil — Aergo token is the fuel that drives the Aergo Platform engine…the token utility is multi-faceted…you need to the token to unlock the potential of Aergo. And We’ll release more information at a later time on our economic model and gas model to fully explain this….soon — Question 7 How will SatoshiPay work as a fiat gateway? which types of businesses will use it and why? who will be supplying the Aergo tokens used for this? Phil — Let me expand our really exciting partnership with Satoshi pay.. It’s important as it gives our community a flavour of (much more) to come in ecosystem partnering. Please see the detailed announcement on Satoshipay for more info. To summarise…This partnership is quite significant. We’re proud to be one of the few projects in this space carving out real partnerships — not just fluff! We plan to integrate SatoshiPay with the Aergo mainnet as well as with the Aergo service layer. This effectively means micropayments for content paywalls and IoT would be settled on our architecture using their amazing technology. It also means the Hub and Marketplace would have a fiat credit-card payment option for ease of use in building solutions for enterprise customers, in addition to that same option being available for dApp developers to create frictionless experiences for new users of their Lua + SQL-based applications. — Question 8 What are PoCs? Kyle — A PoC is a ‘proof of concept’. Most of these projects will be either an ISP, a PoC, or a full scale implementation aka a production system. Phil — Proof of concepts (i.e. demo version of a solution — not for use in full scale production) — Question 9 Hello, have a small question: Blocko is based in Korea, but Aergo was set up in Hong Kong, why so? Phil — We believed Hong Kong is the best place to set up a non-profit organization that acts as a comprehensive free and open-source software foundation. It also helps as a gateway into the mainland China where Aergo tech can solve many problems in large scale manufacturing and supply chain ecosystems. — Question 10What drives demand? Phil — Demand is driven by Awareness — Interest and then Utility — i.e. if people understand what the tech can deliver and it proves to be a good fit — then there will be usage which drives even more demand (through marketing etc…) — Question 11 With the launch of main net how much tps would possibly be delivered 20–30k tps? Also who is in line to explore your product once mainnet goes live? Phil — we are very happy with our lab based mainnet performance — we think the market will be very surprised when they get their hands on our mainnet! — Question 12 Why are u better than LTO Network? Phil — Real customers…top notch engineering team…proven tech and a long term vision with a uniques solution for hybrid enterprise deployments? — Question 13 Welcome Phil. Thanks for having to take out of your busy schedule to have another season with us, I appreciate that you love the community so well and I need to let you that we love you to and sincerely would contribute to the Aergo ecosystem as much as we can. Phil — Thank you just Gaara — I also love our community 😊 — Question 14 So expanding upon this question Phil, are your partnerships mainly MOUs with the government? in past lot of projects have disguised MOUs as partnerships. Phil — If we sign a partnership deal, we’ll announce it as a partnership deal. If we sign a memorandum of understanding, we’ll announce it as a memorandum of understanding. I understand that there’s a lot of hot air in this space and I can assure you we have no place being a part of any of that. We seek out real partners that we can work with to make a strong and meaningful impact on our ecosystem — partners with the most wonderful teams that we can work with to mutual benefit to collectively propel our product forward and set it up as a real competitor to blockchain offerings made by big IT vendors like IBM, Amazon, and Oracle (our real competition). We’ll be definitely announcing more and collaborations as we progress throughout the year. We’ll also be putting out more information on a partner network we’ll be launching that acts as a collective of organizations that don’t just work closely with us, but work together as a member-driven organization to make Aergo a serious contender in the IT space. But we won’t be announcing partnerships that have no substance. In this sense, we may be a little bit different from other projects many of our community follow. Most of our clients are real clients. We’ve built over 20 in-production blockchain systems that save companies hundreds of millions of dollars by maximizing internal efficiencies. When we say we’ve built a document management system operating for every single internal and external employee of Hyundai-Kia Motors in Korea, we’re serious. These aren’t mere MoUs. — Question 15 Results add to big and famous exchanges 1) Save your time and your money 2) best marketing for project Aergo and best advertising for project aergo 3) Increase Aergo stock value Kyle — Definitely. As mentioned, we understand the need to work with quality liquidity providers. But we only aim to work with the best. If there are updates we’ll let you know! — Question 16 Will there be a new quarterly report out soon? Kyle — Of course. They’re called quarterly updates for a reason. You’ll see one for Q2 2019 in April. Phil — Yes — our quarterly reports (QPU) will occur every quarter — typically in week 2 of each new quarter (e.g. wk2 in April/July/October) — Question 17 Hard work and great partner Without marketing Please think to marketing Your marketing is weak Phil — We agree — we need to do a much better job at marketing…I take this personally…both as a challenge and priority…i.e. I WILL OWN THIS ISSUE FROM HEREON…pls give me some time to show how we aim to improve…you will see the results within 6 weeks! — Question 18 1) Time launch main net? 2) Have you plan for add Aergo to big and famous exchange? Kyle — Mainnet is scheduled for end Q1 or early Q2 2019. Keep track live on our GitHub! 😛 — Question 19 Hi Phil. Is blocko actively pushing existing customers to the aergo network and how would aergo incentive this? Considering what they have already is working for them in its current form. Thanks Phil — We have a special biz dev team working with ALL Blocko clients to 1. Educate them on why Aergo makes sense to transition to 2. To find use cases that deliver immediate value and 3. To work on these during 2019…Once mainnet is out you will see some results (quickly!!!) — Question 20 Also I suggest doing weekly updates to the community Phil — Yes you are right Jan — we will be more active with the community…see message above about me OWNING marketing from hereon. — Question 21 Can all the clients/companies keep using Coinstack in the future or do all of them eventually have to migrate to Aergo? Phil — Clients can choose to stay on the older tech or move to newer tech…most will move we believe 😊 — Question 22 Been reading up on you guys and this is my first time joining your ama. On smaller cap companies, or say, SME’s .. do they reap any benefit at all from deploying a blockchain on the aergo network? is it worth it or its very much more suited for larger corps due to costs? Also, pleasure to meet u phil, love your videos Phil — The benefits may be smaller in smaller-scale operations, however they absolutely could still benefit by leverage the immutability of our architecture to create tamper-proof records of things Thanks Robbie — we have new types of videos coming out soon… Watch this space !! — Question 23 @philzamani when do you plan to release the first games on Aergo? (as I remember, you planned them) Will there be games with NFTs? Phil — Need to get tech team to answer this… Kyle — Hey there, Blocko is actually working on a neat game atop Aergo in this area. See these messages Won (CEO Blocko) sent here about it: https://t.me/aergoofficial/99311 Also, this tweet: https://bit.ly/2T2CaqT — Question 24 @Phil I would appreciate if you could clarify whether Aergo block rewards has a certain reward for each block or only transaction fee or a combination. I understand tokenomics paper will be released, but above question can be answered today. Phil — Hi Smita — we will answer all these types of questions very soon in a comprehensive token economics paper… this is quire involved but almost ready to share…BPs and other token stakes will love our model 😊 — Question 25 Phil, your partnerships are good and all; but what if the bear market continues unabated for say 2 more years? Do you have enough runway for project to continue moving along at current pace without hiccups ? Also factor exchange listing costs in this. Phil — This needs a detailed answer…pls bear with me… We’ll be fine..PLEASE READ THE LAST QPU FOR FULL DETAILS. We’ve got great runway and we’re actively watching our cash burn. We talk a LOT about this in our QPU from Q1 2019 and will provide updates every quarter…we also have a professional treasury firm helping us with cash flow and forward planning…this includes a crypto diversification strategy that is working well for Aergo. — Question 26 Where do you see Aergo and the team in 10 years? Realistically 🙃 Phil — Aergo = Recognised brand of one of the most capable enterprise and developer friendly blockchain based platforms and ecosystems. TEAM = continuing to do what they love : delivering great tech and making customers happy and productive with our solutions — Question 27 So we adopting satoshi pay, anything part of Aergo technology will get adopted by satoshi pay? Phil — Please see earlier answer above — lots of great plans to integrate and extend SP within Aergo as a platform and within our own and new dAPPS! — Question 28 Can you explain about fiat payments with aergo hub? Kyle — Sure! Some customers may not want to go through the difficult process of acquiring tokens on exchanges to use our cloud services. So, they may use an off-chain fiat gateway like SatoshiPay. Customers would pay with their credit card and the tokens would be purchased — then consumed for on-chain transactions or services. — Question 29 I wanna know about your hybrid network, what is the very real benefit one would get straight (immediately) if they deploy blockchain on the aergo network compare to competitor.. at lower costs than AWS? Phil — With AWS you have a regionally deployed centralised architecture — with Aergo you have a globally deployed distributed architecture — so if you care about trust, openness and extending your business through a trusted public solution — AWS does not deliver this/Aergo does! — Question 30 Is your office bigger than ICONs? Phil — No but our developer skills are 😉 — Question 31 So when can we expect news on block producers? You mentioned telcos involved? Phil — This is an ongoing program — we can talk about BPs after we deliver our mainnet (not long to go 😉) — Question 32 Can Aergo be used without the token being part of the process? Kyle — Nope. It isn’t really possible. Using off-chain fiat for on-chain txs… ahh, consensus problems I’d imagine. Aergo has to be used for everything. The token is actually critical to the network and usage by customers. As you know, Aergo functions as a serverless platform for deploying blockchain-based enterprise-IT solutions (building real business use cases) as well as deploying decentralized applications. Off the top of my head, companies may decide to (a) implement, provision, deploy a use case by themselves using their existing development resources using our service layer (Hub, Horde, etc), (b) consult with us for the implementation and integration of a solution, © seek out our technical support service, (d) thereafter utilize our services to manage and schedule their blockchain networks seamlessly, (e) run smart contracts or decentralized applications on the Aergo public chain or their own dedicated mainnet anchored to the main chain, (f) instantly purchase computing, storage, AI, data, or other resources needed through the marketplace, and (g) purchase an Aergo named account. I may be missing some things. That covers most of the Hub. All of these actions use the underlying token as a mechanism for payment. Much of this could be done through a fiat gateway to make the process seamless for businesses. Aside from that, the Aergo token is mainly a true utility on the network. It plays a critical role in Sybil protection and stake in the process of securely achieving consensus, similar to how computers stake computational resources to securely achieve consensus on Bitcoin. There is an absolute necessity of it to make sure our public-permissionless chain, which acts as an immutable, trustless settlement layer, can actually exist and function properly. It’s decentralized through a proof of stake model with elected enterprise-grade delegates. We haven’t revealed our token staking (aka economic) model in full detail yet, though we plan to in the future. Hope this helps on the token matter! — Question 33 Nice to hear you @philzamani How do you think Aergo has big chances to become the main blockchain for Korean government?) Phil — We already are heavily involved with a number of government projects …so we are well on our way to broader adoption…this is one reason why we are focusing a lot of our tech-support-sales-biz dev efforts on our home market South Korea in 2019. — Question 34 Hello dear Phil! Any news of upcoming plans for the ambassador program? Phil — Hi itai — yes we are working on a program that ties in with our mainnet launch — all i can share now is the following hints…developers…partners…BPs…we will be ready in mid March to explain this further to our Ambassadors. — Question 35 Hello Phil! @philzamani At TGE, 40% of the core team tokens were unlocked whereas only 10% of the investor tokens were unlocked, how is that rationale? Was the team in so much hurry to get their tokens unlocked to sell at the TGE itself? Phil — This was answered in the QPU in January but let me try again to summarise this.. FACT: No employee had tokens released to date. So it was not possible to sell. This is another example of FUD that we try to address via our QPU reports…our model is simple…we release tokens when we believe the time is right for the project…not the individual (whether investor/employee or other third party)… We always think about: CUSTOMERS+DEVELOPERS+PARTNERS+PROJECT First. Everything else has to follow. > So, no tokens are unlocked till now apart from 10% investor tokens and reward drop tokens? Kyle — No, not true. There’s other token types such as marketing and perhaps other advisor tokens (i.e., exchange competitions, partners). See our token metrics article as it goes over all of that. Some are unlocked for key backers and advisors etc… please refer to the QOPU for more details. https://medium.com/aergo/addressing-the-community-aergos-token-metrics-8441367e4442 > Thanks, can someone please provide me the link for QOPU Kyle — https://paper.aergo.io/Aergo_QPUQ12019_1.0.0.pdf — Question 36 So i’m like an absolute beginner in programming, is there any program for noobs like me to learn to develop on aergo, or like, academies? any direction would be cool, cus i wonder how you guys are dealing with dev support there? Phil — You mean a beginner… Our development guide, docs.aergo.io, is your best bet at this time. Educational programs, getting started guides on our website, and more substantial developer/startup programs are absolutely on the table. We take support seriously…that is why Blocko makes millions every year in delivering and supporting clients…we will provide their skills and know how in Aergo (services and deployment blueprints) — Question 37 How can you stabilise prices because the cost of services will vary depending on token price Kyle — Fees? That’s a good point. They will go up. That’s likely where governance comes into play. Hunyoung (our CTO) went over this here: https://t.me/aergoofficial/81707 Phil — Pls wait for our paper where the whole token economic hypothesis and model are explained… impossible to answer this in a few seconds during an AMA 😉 > Yes because businesses need to plan costs and it would be very difficult if costs were not set and very volatile. Phil —Pls bear a little longer with us until we explain this in our upcoming paper. — Question 38 Will the team be extending their tokens lock up terms? Phil — We have an existing model for all 14 (yes 14!) different token lockup terms — in many cases these are locked for 3 years — we see no reason to change what is a carefully crafted model — also a large portion of tokens will be locked up for a number of years with BPs and ecosystem partners that will drastically reduce the total circulating supply… We will explain this in more detail in our next QPU — Question 39 Will blockos clients begin porting right after mainnet? Phil — This needs explaining… All organizations have their own inherent commercial business needs. Many of our customers have used identity authentication solutions built by us to streamline the process of verifying identities of customers in payment processes; others had us implement document management systems to reduce costs and increase security around operational matters and administration. There are some areas where a use case may be simpler to implement and others where it may be harder. There may be some areas where there is greater incentive to port onto Aergo and there may be some areas where there is less incentive. Existing customers will have a few ways to begin leveraging Aergo. They can begin by hashing block headers from their private chains to the mainnet to enhance immutability as well as elements of data integrity. The public chain acts as a notary in this sense. There is great incentive to do this because it doesn’t incur too many switching costs and is inexpensive with regards to fees. At the same time, the benefits in creating a sense of tamper-proof ability are significant. Anchoring will act as each existing customer’s first exposure to the Aergo network From there, they could establish B2B collaborations with third-parties using our technology. This increases the possibilities of what they’re able to do with their data by building cross organizational use cases. There is significant value to capture here, and the public chain acts as the secure distributed trust layer underneath for both organizations to ensure two parties with their own interests in mind don’t have to trust one another, or trust an intermediary. This also isn’t so simple. It takes significant integration and consultation efforts for this type of an implementation to work; these types of projects are often extremely complex. At the same time, these types of complex projects that don’t just supplement legacy infrastructure but could potentially over time replace it are exactly what we’ve been doing for the past few years when we moved on from doing PoC’s in 2016. We anticipate that we’ll begin making such transactions as we draw into the year. But it’s important to note that such transactions take time to complete. We anticipate that almost all of our projects will evolve in this way: minimalistic to maximalistic. They may start as simple data anchoring solutions, evolve into a private blockchain to enhance internal operations, then eventually into a hybrid blockchain solution that the company uses to collaborate with third-parties securely in real-time to build new innovative apps and services. — Question 40 @philzamani will Aergo support generation of other tokens similar to ERC20 with ETH, TRC10 with Tron? Kyle — Of course! We have the contract for our ERC-20-type token already out, called ATHENA-370 Check it out on our GitHub! 😃 — Question 41 Every time i see a publication on enterprise blockchain it’s about hyperledger / eth enter or r3.. aergo isn’t covered much besides icon all about 😮do you guys think forming an alliance like aergo enterprise alliance to showcase your clients use case and actual deployment ? i know much is private for obvs reason Phil — We focus on building and implementing solutions for customers. We’ve always been execution driven; act more, talk less. We’ll certainly get better at this. We’ve got plans to launch a member-driven network of organizations focused on Aergo’s growth in the future. Details released at a later time. — Question 42 Hi everyone, thanks for doing this Phil and team. The Telegram AMAs are really important for the community to be able to engage and learn more about Aergo Phil — Hi Daniel — we know how important our community is — we will try even harder to make our communication with you even more rewarding and insightful — Question 43 Btw in your previous AMA i think i recall someone asking if the aergo system has any benefit for investors or holders to make active/passive/ type of income by holding Aergo tokens. Is there any incentive here? Phil — Let me try to answer this one clearly… There absolutely is a reward for stakers on our network. We’ll release more information on our economic model at a later time.. Our model looks at all network participants to reward good and active support of our users… More soon. — Question 44 What plans are made to provide more liquidity for aergo ?? Like more exchanges? Kyle — Addressed — scroll up! In short, we understand the need to work with liquidity providers and we look to work with the best. Real liquidity not fake liquidity! Phil — See earlier answers…we are actively working on this — Question 45 Nice idea. Also, why dont u guys establish relation with icon? it looks like they are deeply involved with the government like u guys.. Phil — We work with anyone who helps our customers and developers — To date no client has asked us to pull in ICON (you can decide yourself what this means!) > South korean gov investing $1b to blockchain startups ❤ should be work together Phil — We are actively working on many of these projects sponsored by this large investment by the forward looking government of S. Korea 😊 > Wow really! do keep news rolling, even if it’s stories of office life and meetings or events.. i feel ur community would have more personal relationship. — Phil — I just want a write a few more words about our partnership with SatoshiPay. Specifically how it will work as a fiat gateway…. The price of services in Aergo is always tokens. The token is the sole, programmable means of on-chain exchange on the Aergo network. However, third parties can offer gateway services that essentially take your fiat currency to purchase tokens and spend them for the service you’re looking to purchase. We’ll release hard details on the collaboration once integration efforts are complete, and that will be after our mainnet is live, stable, and functional. It’ll be a great addition to our existing rich usage enhancements provided in the Hub/Horde/Marketplace! Where the tokens come from will also be ironed out in the future. We’re looking at liquidity providers. We’re also in the process of making a neat explainer on how on-chain settlement of transfers works, which we look to release soon! More information in the future. — Question 46 You guys saw the google bigquery analyzing public blockchains like ethereum, eth classic, bitcoin, blabla.. How much of the aergo network would be ‘exposed’ for analysis by capable partis and would it pose any risk? Random but i fear of google being the search engine for public chain.. Phil — The Aergo public chain is public is an open book, available for anyone to analyze just like any other permissionless public chain. Its characteristic of providing an immutable audit trail has its benefits though some believe it has its drawbacks. Companies that want to keep their information private will run private chains while hashing block headers onto the main chain. All processes will be done in a GDPR/data privacy regulation compliant way. In short, there won’t be any inherent risks. — Question 47 Hey Phil, what happened to ambassador’s role? What they are doing? Phil — We are late following up as we decided to focus on near term important priorities… The Ambassadors will hear directly from me in early March… Pls bear with me 😊 — Question 48 Is nexledger accelerator related to blocko? I saw blocko made nexledger or help to make before with coinstack. Also Saw hyperledger using them and is it out of blocko’s technology.. It’s a strange relationship samsung has with both icon and aergo as they are either backing or partners or so yes Phil — One for the tech team as i am not sure here 😉 Samsung is a very large company…you can search to see which company they directly invested in (multiple times!!) 😉 Need to run so so will stay on for 15 more mins to answer any questions that come in or that I may have missed (sorry!) — Question 49 Will Aergo be integrated into the new Samsung phone? Phil — No comment! — Question 50 Phil — Just want to come back to why Aergo vs AWS or other systems.. It’s important to understand this.. To start, deploying a blockchain is just the means. You want to build a solution around a hybrid network to save costs and increase efficiency while at the same time exponentially maximizing security of your IT infrastructure. Both public and private chain solutions have benefits and drawbacks: pros and cons exist either way. What we provide is a product that lets you easily leverage those benefits of both approaches, while at the same time reducing the drawbacks of both approaches. You could integrate a deployment with your existing IT infrastructure to create tamper-proof records of things like events, documents, or transactions through hashes. You could also automate the process of sharing and using data from third parties securely to maximize efficiencies and build new business models. You can even build a dApp on your own dedicated sidechain for enhanced control and fee-cost-effectiveness. Everything will be incredibly easy to use; we propose a very rich set of developer tools and enhancements to the developer experience, as well as a very easy to use blockchain deployment/provisioning/management engine. — Phil — Soon we will be doing a number of surveys with our community to get your feedback on some important next steps for Aergo and to improve our marketing and engagement with you. Please participate as we are listening and want to make this channel even better than it is. — Question 51 Curious on dapps, aside from real estate, settlement for b2b, any interesting industry aergo can cater? Maybe on legal or insurance side. Phil — This is a good question : Which industries do we serve? The real answer is many…we actually don’t focus in a specific industry. We focus in realistic and practical deployment models ie. finding real life uses cases that: 1. Can use our tech 2. Deliver real solution now (not a white paper) 3.Provide an ROI (return on investment) to customers now (not in the future) This has worked well for Blocko for the past 4 years and we will continue down this path for many years to come! Legal and insurance are two we are looking into — is Public Healthcare Records… Autonomous vehicles… IoT mixed with AI/ML… and many more 😊 — Question 52 Would there be an Aergo SDK released along with the main network with tools that enable developers build dApps with basic knowledge of blockchain. If it would not be released immediately pls when? Kyle — We already have our SDK out with our testnet in Java, JavaScript, and Python. Also a package manager for smart contracts, and some more stuff! They’ll all be available on our mainnet. Phil — ABSOLUTELY! we are 100% developer and customer focused — watch this space — many developers will love and appreciate the tools. blueprints and support we provide them!!! We take support seriously…that is why Blocko makes millions every year in delivering and supporting client. We will provide their skills and know how in Aergo (services and deployment blueprints) — Question 53 Seoul metropolitan government is using ICON’s public blockchain? Where do you feel you stand in relation to their progress and partnerships? Phil — Ok let me elaborate here as I am well aware of this project.. We believe that while we are dominating the South Korean blockchain scene already, there’s significant value that remains to be captured. From what we’ve seen, many companies have still yet to capture the powerful semantics of hybrid blockchain designs to reduce costs and increase security in a wide variety of focus areas. These companies have implemented systems like ours to increase efficiencies internally, however few have managed to build full-scale implementations of workflows with external organizations using blockchain. We’ve begun early stages of this with many such as the Jeju province of Korea to, for example, connect government networks with banks to streamline the process of notarizing transactions. Companies using Aergo to share data with each other and use each other’s information to build new use cases and business ecosystems is the epitome of what we envision. It also isn’t so outlandish given what we know and have experienced. We don’t need to completely up end IT backplanes and infrastructures to make this happen. This type of collaboration also isn’t happening right now in a ‘real-time’. It isn’t viable without the use of distributed architecture. This is where so much value lies. With so much value to capture, it’ll be interesting to see what companies manage to win. We believe that rather than the market share in this area being equally distributed, it will instead be captured by a few major players.. Big IT vendors like IBM will play a part, though they won’t make it far. I’ve seen new technologies grow for over twenty years so I have an innate understanding of how this all works. As a team we’ve got an edge because we’ve got serious customer know-how and experience. Our architecture is very well designed, planned out, and is being engineered excellently. It is created to solve the limitations and flaws of blockchain systems that we came across acting as one of the only companies implementing blockchain-based systems for over four years now. Our solution takes all of that experience and culminates it to be extremely adaptable, exposed to the market through many existing in-production deployments and partners, and provides excellent low-cost cloud computing solutions in the process. We’re already working with the Korean province of Jeju in implementing a blockchain-based land registry solution for the region. We completed a PoC last year, then a follow-on PoC with 11 of the largest banks in Jeju thereafter in January. Now we’ll move on to a full-scale implementation (once the Ministry had funding for the project approved — it’s currently pending). This implementation could turn into something that uses Aergo heavily. We’ll talk more about this one when the time is right — Question 54 Hi Phil, Thanks for second AMA How u see Aergo for next two years from now? Phil — Mainstream platform in use by many developers — customers and partners around the world 😊 — Question 55 What is the polaris server you guys launched recently? i don’t understand. Kyle — Polaris is a server which nodes can connect to to find other nodes. It’s a node discovery tool in essence. So if I want to join the network as a validator, I’d use Polaris. Docs.aergo.io excerpt: — Question 55 When lambo? Phil — Time to end this AMA 😊 Let me close by thanking all of you who took part in today’s AMA and thanks again for Kyle joining in to help me — you will soon see a positive change in how we communicate and how we market Aergo… Please bear with us.. and thanks to our Russian and Ukrainian and Korean friends who will translate and circulate the above AMA in their respective channels! Now we have got to get back to work (Mainnet, here we come 😊) Kyle — 👍👍👍 Thanks everyone for attending! We look forward to sharing more great updates with you all. 🙏 Any more questions just feel free to mention me and ask. As stated in our opening message, we’ll try to answer what we can and are able to. Have a great day everyone. — -- -- The Blockchain For The WORLD AERGO, The Blockchain For Everyone.

Here is the transcript: 1. What advice would you give to a student that is looking to venture into this field? I would advise to focus on one aspect of digital marketing per say and become an expert at it; however, I would highly recommend that you do not limit yourself to one aspect of Digital Marketing. You should be aware and knowledgeable of all aspects of what Digital Market offers to its audience. If you are a graphic designer; learn Photoshop, InDesign, but also study UX, web development, Marketing/Social Media Strategies. The more you understand of Digital Marketing conceptually and the various facets/marketing vehicles it offers and how they work; the more marketable you become as a Potential Hire. Furthermore, by learning all aspects of this field, it can help assist your creativity and/or make your Marketing strategies more effective. Keep Learning. There are several online tools and courses available for anyone to continue their education and practice. A lot of resources are free and there are several Digital Marketing Experts who have insightful online blogs, courses, Twitter Chats, etc. that one can take advantage of. The Tech and Digital Marketing field is constantly changing; so staying connected, learning and practicing is highly recommended. Other factors to consider: 2. When reviewing applications and potential candidates to work with, what is something that stands out to you? I think someone who is confident but one that is willing to learn and that is a good team player. In our industry, a Designer, Video Producer, Web Developer, Social Media Strategist is one member of the team. Communication skills and willing to work with others is key. Also, having a good understanding of UX and the importance of establishing goals, objectives and ways to measure success for any design, strategy, tool is also important. We want someone who isn’t just looking to create something; but someone who can understand an objective, create with a purpose and track its success. Work should be relevant to the client’s objectives. 3. What are the creative steps you take when working with a new client? It depends on the project/Digital Marketing Vehicle we are producing, but typically we follow this workflow: These were my quick fire answers. I am always interested in feedback. I personally have been in the tech field for over a decade working as a Project/Program Manager. I would love to hear from you. -- -- #TechieByDesign,Web/IT Program Manager-Runner by day, RoadRunner 4 Life, UTSA Alumn 🤙🏽 #BIRDSUP- SPURS🏀TEXANS 🏈#girlgotsportsskills #MusicLover #musicallday Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*kNHrqHUUkPjVBE3X.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*kNHrqHUUkPjVBE3X.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*kNHrqHUUkPjVBE3X.jpg"

Oh yea, I member Lan Partys…. Member link cables? swapping games? and those expensive places we used to call arcades?… In this post-Twitch age, “couch co-op” (or as we used to call it “playing video games”) has become a niche sub-genre; a novel gaming element not suited to the average modern gaming siblings, seemingly isolated with their own gadgets and computers. To those of us lamenting the loss of the old school methods for connecting with our fellow gamers, streaming culture was convicted culprit and was not to be trusted. “Why would you want to watch someone playing games?”. To my younger brother however (who is only 4 years younger) the noughties were character defining times influenced heavily by the pioneers of internet personalities/streamers. He embraced many weird, uncharacteristic, low profile youtubers and made strong connections with them. His streamer influence even took him as far as moving to Taiwan, purely inspired by a weird dude who made time-lapse motorbike videos around the country. I remember the first thing he tried to share with me that highlighted how far our worlds were drifting at the time; it was “Yu-gi-Oh! The Abridged series”, a fan fiction re-dub of the cartoon that he found hilarious but seemed like it came from another planet to me.“Why would you want to watch someone being an idiot?”. It wasn’t until I moved into proper individualist adult life that I slowly started to get my head around streaming culture. It would be a week day evening, just in from the rat race, everyone I know just in from rat race, tomorrow I have go back to said rat race…. The idea of racing rats to a pals house to play games is not hugely appealing. Never mind, headset with xboxlive basically is couch co-op right?… crap, no one is online, try playstation…. who’s on the playstation network at the moment…. Dave Barnes ahhhh no thanks I would rather watch twitch than play with that prick… and there you have it. That thought process sums up how I slowly started to understand my brothers obsession with streamers. Everyone I know in real life either grew up and stopped playing games every night of the week, or became intolerable due to either child birth, drug abuse or finding god. A 2019 Lan party at Louie Snacks house would be very depressing. However a 2019 Lan party at my younger brothers crib in Taiwan would be popping. It would be full of gamers from all walks life, even the new female ones I see they have on twitch now. The irony is; while I sit here as a 30 year old man moaning about the lack of split screen, without anyone to even play with, there is a mega niche of gamers in their 30’s enjoying a golden age of co-op indie games. Rejoicing in each other company via discord, youtube and twitch, they laugh at the memory of having to share a screen with another player. -- -- Louie Snacks aka Louie G Dog — DJ and Entertainment Specialist; Music Maker, Comedy Creator and Video Game Gamer.

Lessons and takeaways from our first try.,"Hosting an academy in your company, especially in the IT business is becoming the norm. It resonates with words such as innovation, community, open-minded, contribution, and is also a great way to strengthen your brand awareness and attract new talent.",Rokas Petrošius,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Rokas Petrošius Follow Adapt Tech blog -- Listen Share We took the idea of creating an academy at Adapt Lithuania, combined it with our wish to give something back to the development community and created something new and exciting for us. The goal was to open an academy for talented new developers who want to get the taste of real life development experience; introduce them to the necessary tools, methods as well as teach them new competencies. We have not only advised them in development but also introduced them to design, user experience, and project managing as they all compliment each other. Sounds easy,right? It should be all good and smooth. After all, there are so many great courses online, you copy what’s there, adjust, make a schedule, tell your employees to go and teach the young padawans their expertise and you’re set. Well… not exactly. I could describe this more like a roller-coaster that was a little scary, but you get the joy at the end of it. In case you are planning to make an academy of yours too, or want to learn something about the process of having one, I would like to share some of the takeaways we had in our first year, which ended up being a success. First, some context of our academy: 50 entries (of which 20 got picked), two study tracks — front-end and back-end with 12 and 8 students respectively. 16 classes/workshops during the span of 2 months, each class lasting about 1.5–2 hours. One final project per group of max 3 students. Here we go. The lecturers in our academy came from different teams. They might have worked with each other before, but not necessarily. In the beginning there was a lot of questions, and — I’d say — a healthy level of skepticism about why the heck do we need to an academy at all? Why the effort? No matter what the perspectives were in the beginning, they have changed drastically. Preparing for lecturing, structuring the academy, discussing what are the best approaches, all opened up our mind and changed some of the dynamics in the office. Suddenly we were a part of a new team now. Team with a new goal and purpose — sharing and teaching. We have started talking about various problems that we never used to, we got to know each other on different aspects and got to work with different strengths and weaknesses that were not so much used in our everyday work or in the teams that we were working. Great possibility to work on those soft skills and open up for new ideas. This one is plain simple; it took a toll on us. When you have an academy, and your full-time employees are your lecturers, you have to take into account that random is inevitable. A client wants this workshop, a conference happens, or lecturer has something that completely messes up his schedule, and he can’t show up. You never know when one might get sick as well. What we recommend is the the following: Have at least two guys who can teach the same if you want to be safe and avoid schedule changes which lead to demotivation. Also, possibly reduced knowledge retention by students as the time goes by without building on prior taught knowledge. Have strict schedule timetable laid out before you even start to advertise your academy. It seems a no brainer, but it is significant. People like to plan and if your goal is attracting as many and as qualified students as possible, you better plan accordingly. Who’s your audience, what do they do in life? What time fits them the best? If your audience are students, be aware of their exams and other time consuming period in their academic life. Make it clear, visible and if needed — flexible. So you gather a room full of students, show them all the slides you been working on so hard. Explain the content and give live examples, home reading and then they leave home, to try to revisit the content of the lectures and boom… Wipeout. We can only retain that much of information in our head. It’s tough to remember all the technical subtleties and things that were shown, told or questions that were given and answered spontaneously during the lecture. Therefore remember to do something to capture the things that are going in the classroom — screencast your lecture, record video/audio and make sure you share it with your students. Learning efficiency and information retainment rates will improve. We are a bunch of programmer guys. Some extrovert, more of us introvert which is possibly related to problem-solving skills. Like most people we have fears. In particular, public speaking, not being understood and not knowing enough to actually teach. We faced our little demons and got a boost to our self-esteem by delivering our knowledge and getting positive feedback from the students. This applies to every challenge one takes in life. Everything comes back as an experience which results in growth. Also when you teach, you need to explain complex concepts in an easy to understand manner. That is hard and requires you to challenge your way of thinking and communicating as well. While this could come as a default for most human beings, think of what respect means in your context. For us it is staying open-minded, paying attention, understanding others and admiring the excitement to learn and, not least, accepting that making mistakes is an essential part of learning. Endorsing the effort no matter the outcome. We expect the same attitude from our students. This also involves respecting the schedule, homework, group work and each other on a peer level. Not paying respect should have consequences as it misaligns with some of the core values. Where there is respect, there is no conflict. In the beginning, we were very excited to teach quite a wide variety of topics in order to let our students “feel” what it takes to be a developer. Giving them a wide range of technology and processes was a double-edged blade. We did excite them by including project management, user experience, and design subjects into development course. It was a great idea indeed. What we also did was overwhelm our students with a variety of technical subjects and fast pace (which is the consequence of the latter). They had a hard time retaining and understanding the information. Therefore the quantity of topics is not the main priority.The priority is how much depth and proper tempo you can provide in your case. Be aware not to overwhelm, and strive maintain focus. Also, ask during the lectures if everyone is on the same page with the lecturer. Last, but not least, make sure you know the audience you want to gather. It’s like the target audience of any project or product. Gather the wrong one, and you will introduce boundaries, things won’t go smoothly, and you will face resistance. If there is a test to attend your courses, make sure questions test a broad enough variety of skills, critical and logical thinking. Also talk to your students — before, during and after the courses. Get feedback, see what they live by, what drives them, what is the thing they are seeking and whether they got it from what you did. It is essential for the growth of your academy. Communication is key to understanding. This can’t be stressed enough. Hopefully, you can learn something from this reflective list. One thing I can tell is that every bit of this experience was worth it, and we are going to make it happen again. This time even better.

The Human Cell Atlas aims to create a foundational resource with the power to transform our understanding of health and disease. We’re proud to support this international effort by funding 38 collaborative, multidisciplinary science teams as part of the Seed Networks for the Human Cell Atlas. Over 200 grantees — physicians, experimental scientists, and computational scientists — will contribute data and tools towards a first draft of the Human Cell Atlas. Learn about CZI’s Seed Networks grantees and the insights they’re gaining into what shapes our health: Immunofluorescence microscopy is a technique where researchers thinly slice tissues and treat them with dyes to track the proteins that define unique features or processes present in a cell and can help diagnose diseases like cancer. A team of three researchers from Hungary, Denmark, and Sweden will use this method to study healthy and diseased human liver cells. “These types of images will be the starting point for our project studying deep visual proteomics, or sets of proteins. I hope this work will take us one step closer to the next generation of pathology.” — Emma Lundberg, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. To develop the first cell map of the human lung, an international network of 16 researchers will study adult and pediatric tissue using single cell and spatial genomics, microscopy, anatomic, and computational methods. “We aim to develop a cell atlas of the healthy adult lung that will serve as a roadmap for future studies focused on lung disease.” — Alexander Misharin, Northwestern University, United States. Oligodendrocyte cells produce myelin, a fatty material that protects nerve cells. The immune system destroys myelin in multiple sclerosis, a disease of the central nervous system that disrupts the flow of information within the brain and between the brain and body. Three researchers from Switzerland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are working together to understand the characteristics of these important cells in samples from people of different regions, ages, and sexes. “Our research will give new insights on the complexity of oligodendrocytes in the human brain and spinal cord. This might allow us to better understand their function in normal physiology, but also in several neurological pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis, leukodystrophies, and spinal cord injuries.” — Gonçalo Castelo-Branco, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden. 17 researchers across the world — from Singapore to Canada to Israel — will use computational tools to build a single cell map of the human liver. “We are honored and excited to be joining forces with the best liver experts worldwide for this fantastic project using disruptive technologies to unravel the interactions between each of the individual building blocks that make a healthy human liver. This project will without any doubt change hepatology forever — the textbooks will have to be rewritten!” — Martin Guilliams, Ghent University, Belgium.

They plan to build a breast cell atlas that includes 100 women of multiple ages, breast sizes/densities, ethnicities, and body mass indexes to help ensure diversity when constructing the first draft of the Human Cell Atlas. The Seed Networks is supporting two groups studying breast tissue; a different group of researchers will map the normal breast of ethnically diverse populations, including women of European, African, Latina, and Asian ancestry. Whether tendon problems affect the shoulder, knee, or ankle, they can cause almost constant pain. 11 researchers from the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Denmark are part of the Tendon Seed Network to create a roadmap of what healthy tendons look like. This will help researchers assess current treatments and develop new ones. “Our bioactive scaffolds allow tendon cells to grow and proliferate. Tendon cells respond to the chemistry and organization of these scaffolds, and we can use this response to design implantable scaffolds to successfully repair torn and diseased tendons.” — Sarah Snelling, University of Oxford, United Kingdom. A group of six researchers from three institutions is creating a cell atlas of the female reproductive system, including the ovaries, fallopian tube, and uterus. “This work will transform our understanding of the intricacies of the female reproductive system and allow us to appreciate human physiology at an entirely new level.” — Erica Marsh, University of Michigan, United States. These stunning photos look like corals or deep-sea creatures. In fact, they’re models of human intestines. Scientists study these 3D models of cells — called organoids — to better understand how diseases affect our bodies’ organs and to develop effective treatments. Researcher Prisca Liberali is part of a project with five other researchers to describe how multiple organs from a single individual develop over time. Three researchers working in Washington State and Missouri are using algorithms to study nine different types of tissue from 250 individuals to better understand how complex tissues form and function. “We use advanced machine learning algorithms to reconstruct the unique histories and identities of single cells. These algorithms have helped us understand model systems, and further development will allow us to explore human genetic variation and provide explanations of how our tissues are built from different types of cells.” — Cole Trapnell, University of Washington, United States. “Identifying all cell types in the female pelvis will help us to find cures for intractable conditions such as ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and infertility.” — Ernst Lengyel, University of Chicago, United States. Lengyel is leading a team of four researchers from the University of Chicago to characterize all cell types in the healthy female human reproductive system. They will also develop tools to analyze information from the data they gather. To study the effects of aging across the human lifespan, eight researchers working across the United Kingdom and the United States are mapping cellular diversity in the human immune system across multiple tissues and ages. “Our atlas of immune populations in human organs will be an invaluable reference for disease, aging, and therapies that harness the immune system.” — Peter Sims, Columbia University, United States. A team of researchers at the University of Irvine, California studying breast cancer conducted a pilot project funded by CZI where they profiled 200,000 breast tissue cells from 20 individuals. They documented over 12 cell types and 31 states. In a new Seed Networks project, the researchers plan to bring in additional interdisciplinary experts to expand this initial effort. “Our recently published single cell-level census of the breast epithelium revealed two previously unrealized distinct cell types within the luminal compartment of the breast epithelium. The Human Breast Cell Atlas will allow us to identify previously unrealized cell types and lead to a better grasp of how cells communicate with each other in normal tissue homeostasis and disease.” — Kai Kessenbrock, University of California, Irvine, United States. Researchers from Japan, Singapore, and South Korea are teaming up to build an atlas of Asian immune cell types and states across five major Asian population groups (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, and Malay). They will characterize variations such as those associated with ethnicity, environment, age, sex, and body mass index. “Our network aims to characterize immune cell differences within and between Asian population groups, and thereby explain differences in physiology and disease.” — Shyam Prabhakar, Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore. -- -- Supporting the science and technology that will make it possible to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century.

Felippe Silveira Follow MOWE Studio -- Listen Share I know you can easily see the paradox in the title. Being a remote company — or just working remotely — comes with many advantages: a more flexible lifestyle, the ability to work wherever we want, and the easiness of connecting with clients and peers around the world without leaving our desks. Honestly, I can’t complain how impactful going remote was to me in both personal and professional aspects of life. I can work with the people I want to without the need to live next to them. I can visit my family and be there when they need me, without needing to ask permission to do so or even worrying about missing some days in the office — as long as I maintain a nice balance with my job. The remote work environment is full “benefits,” but to succeed in this world, we can’t forget the human touch. It’s not difficult nowadays to transform all our social interactions into screen interactions. We change in-person meetings for video calls; handwritten notes for Whatsapp or SMS messages; seeing a friend for liking and tagging their pictures on Instagram; etc. I won’t lie, we all do that, and I’m not here to condemn Social Media or the “evolution” of human communication. I confess I love it. We are more connected than ever and we can reach those we love whenever we want to with a single device in our pockets. However, in a world where technology allowed us to be more connected, whenever we can be “in-person,” more memorable these moments are. When was the last time you received a handwritten letter? Actually, have you ever received any? Even though these primordial means of communication seem to be fading away, they are more vigorous than ever. I don’t have a backup of the messages I exchanged with my wife during all those years we’ve been together, but I keep all the letters and notes we wrote to each other. Although it creates excellent memories in a personal relationship, it’s not exclusive to that. The same applies perfectly to business. In a world where both us and our clients are dealing with emails and text messages every day, being able to leave — for example — a personal handwritten letter turns it into a remarkable experience. Even better than leaving notes and letters, is to be vis-à-vis with someone. We spend so much time of our days face to face with a screen that we miss this human connection. Yes, we can do a lot by email and messages in a Slack channel, but I don’t remember a single time I had a blast sending an email, I just remember the many coffees I had with interesting people I met in-person. Transforming a digital connection into an in-person meeting creates what I call the “long-term friend effect.” When you are chatting with someone online for months — or even years — and you have the experience of meeting her in person, the described effect happens. Even with just a few months-long relationships, talking in person with someone you only knew online creates the same effect as when we go back to our hometown and see our childhood friends again. These encounters can make any relationships even stronger, and because the conversation started online, when you’re face to face with the other person, it seems you know each other for many many years. The remote work environment made it easier for us to talk in a matter of seconds to many clients and team members in different states and countries. It’s tricky to believe email is all it takes to nourish relationships. The truth is that in business, everything I said here is even stronger. With the constant efforts of many companies to stand-out, most don’t realize that to be on top, you need to be in front. In front of your prospects. In front of your clients. Face-to-face. Just “being in town” and grabbing a coffee together creates an impact thousands of emails could never achieve. While all your competitors are emailing, texting and calling your clients you should be there in front of them, enjoying some time together, and creating experiences. It’s hard to stick in our memories the texts on an email or the voice over the phone when compared to real experiences lived together. Working remotely doesn’t mean you need to be absent. It’s a matter of choosing to be 100% present whenever possible. To thrive as a remote worldwide business, we need to be more human. Instead of dealing with screens, texts, and numbers on a daily basis, create human, warm connections. The key to success here is to bring humanity to the (sometimes) cold, remote world. -- -- Stories about both animation and remote culture, business and marketing.

https://medium.com/@SamRadOfficial/what-blockchain-and-google-maps-have-in-common-and-what-we-can-expect-next-d049a72fb901?source=tag_archive---------35-----------------------,What Blockchain and Google Maps Have In Common And What We Can Expect Next,Written by Sam Rad 🔮 · Samantha Radocchia,Sam Rad 🔮 · Samantha Radocchia,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sam Rad 🔮 · Samantha Radocchia Follow -- Listen Share The following is adapted from Bitcoin Pizza: The No-Bullshit Guide to Blockchain. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? Or, to put it another way, which came first, the cryptocurrency or the infrastructure? The answer to that question isn’t as clear cut as it first appears. The natural response is to think that an infrastructure needs to be set up and established before applications can be built out. But the process is far more iterative and not nearly as linear as it seems. The classic example is the light bulb, which was invented before the electric grid was put in place. The electric grid wasn’t necessary to light up a light bulb: electricity could be generated locally. However, it was necessary to build electric grids before broader consumer adoption of light bulbs was possible. Broad consumer adoption then led to a profusion of new and different kinds of light bulbs. Similarly, airplanes were invented before airports, but airports were required before airplanes and air travel could be widely adopted. All evolutionary processes seem to follow the same pattern. A more recent and perhaps more relevant example is the internet itself. Basic internet protocols like TCP/IP were in place before the internet was widely adopted by the general public. During the technology’s evolution, there was a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between its infrastructural and application layers. Once the web browsers that made it possible for the average person to use the internet arrived, setting off a series of competitive “browser wars,” new consumer applications were proposed that required further infrastructural development before becoming truly viable. Internet service providers led to web portals, which led to search engines and then e-commerce applications like Amazon. How is the above relevant to blockchain? It can give us a glimpse into the possible path of what is still a very new technology. We’re still early in the blockchain development cycle. New applications will be built that require further infrastructure and protocol development. These iterative cycles will continue to move exponentially in an upward trajectory, but there will be losers as well as winners, and many “learning experiences” on this evolutionary journey. Some applications and protocols will emerge as a gold standard, while others will fade into irrelevance. Since this is an iterative process, we really have no idea how it is going to develop. The “fortune tellers” who claim to know are just that. No one can predict the future. Twenty years ago, who could have fathomed, much less predicted, what Google, Facebook, and Amazon would become? By way of comparison, consider MapQuest. In the late nineties and early 2000s, MapQuest was queen. You could go to its website, enter two locations, and get directions. You printed them out, referred to them while driving, then stuffed them into your glove compartment, adding to the accumulating mess. Fast-forward to 2005. Google Maps, a similar mapping and directions tool, entered the market. Yet it was different. It wasn’t just a better map. It launched its API, which allowed other developers to use and build on top of its data. Within a few years, we saw the rise of the demand economy. We saw Uber. We saw Lyft. In short order, we saw the various offshoots: “Uber for food delivery,” “Uber for dog walking,” “Uber for companionship,” “Uber for doctors on demand,” “Uber for ____________.” You fill in the blank. Why is this important? When Google created Google Maps, the world was still thinking in terms of MapQuest and printing out directions on sheets of paper. People thought that a MapQuest digital map was an innovation, and it was. However, it was still a restricted, linear way to think about the implications of real-time location data. The world was still thinking in terms of creating a “better map.” MapQuest didn’t see the possibilities for the Ubers, the Airbnbs, the food delivery services, and the “on-demand” economy, which would totally reshape our lives. Google Maps did. If you had asked the MapQuest folks what their customers wanted, they would have said a better map. No one could have predicted that, in 2005, with the launch of Google Maps and their open approach to an API for sharing real-time location data, we would see the rise of an entire generation of unicorn tech companies: Uber, Lyft, Yelp, Airbnb, Delivery.com, Grubhub — the list goes on. The paradigm shift that enabled people to see a map as dynamic rather than static ushered in the entire “on-demand” economy. We’re at an analogous place today with blockchain. At the moment, there is confusion about which developments belong in the infrastructure and which in the application categories. The point is that these categories, while important, are far from hard-and-fast. It’s critical to recognize that blockchain and cryptocurrency are part — an essential part — of the greater seismic sociocultural, geopolitical, economic, and technological shifts now taking place. Blockchain is not simply a new technology — a MapQuest — it’s a new way of seeing, understanding, and interacting with the world — a Google Maps. As such, we can’t yet know for sure where it will take us. Collectively, the shift of which blockchain is part is often referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This shift encompasses advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, additive manufacturing, the Internet of Things, robotics, and genomics. The convergence of these technologies will impact the future of production, work, community, commerce, and everything in between. It’s impossible to understand what’s happening by reducing the interactions among all these technologies to a simple, two-dimensional map. What’s occurring is multidimensional and therefore hard to fathom. This unique historical moment represents the convergence not just of multiple technologies, but of new ideas. Our thinking will shift from centralized to decentralized, opaque to transparent, siloed to open, reactive to proactive, and regulated to self-enforcing. When I look at the greater evolution of thought taking place at the current moment, a term like “Fourth Industrial Revolution” doesn’t seem to do this seismic paradigm shift justice. Perhaps the last time in human history we saw so significant a shift was the Paleolithic revolution, when humans took the evolutionary step of making and wielding tools. All subsequent revolutions, from the agrarian to the industrial to the internet revolution, represent accelerations of existing tool making. The revolution we are now experiencing represents an evolution of thought and therefore requires us to conceive of and build new tools. If you don’t buy that blockchain, as a technology, will be the backbone of this change, at least try to understand that it is a manifestation of a much larger evolutionary sociocultural process. What will the next infrastructure-application matrix — the next light-bulb-and-energy-grid feedback loop — consist of? My sense is that what will emerge will include not only specific solutions or applications, but new ways of doing business and making transactions, along with new organizational and governance models. This could have implications for voting and government, even including the demise of the concept of the nation-state, which our globalized and connected context seems to have rendered outdated. We just don’t know, except that we do know fundamental transformation will take place at many different levels. Very little in this new, unfamiliar world appears certain. What does seem clear is that, given what we’ve already seen in the multiple rises and collapses of various cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks, it’s going to be a wild ride. - — - Hungry for more?

To those of us who work in technology, the quality and scope of the attack came as no surprise. Indeed, even calling it an “attack” may be overwrought, as we shall see. These distributed denial of service events (DDoS), as they are called, have become an unpleasant but established fact of networked life. A DDoS takes place when some disgruntled or malignant soul sets a bunch of mindless network-bots to flood an Internet server (or its network as a whole), and its applications, with requests. So many requests, in fact, that those who wish to access those services legitimately are prevented from doing so by the flood. Sometimes the request can be for a specific web page or set of web pages. At other times, it can be more generic traffic that targets a specific server, or range of IP addresses. Whatever the case, it uses up network resources and bandwidth that would otherwise be used for humans to get and receive information in their browsers and apps. To make the flood more difficult to staunch, the attacker will use a bunch of, say, hijacked broadband routers and the like across the world to make those requests continuously, like a global zombie army. Because these requests are widespread and can be from myriad locations across the globe (and from what might otherwise be legitimate broadband routers and so on), it becomes difficult for a network administrator to differentiate them from legitimate traffic to the site. Hence the “distributed” as the first D in DDoS. If the nefarious flood came from but one node, it would be possible to simply block all traffic from that node and all would be well. But what if the traffic lies across hundreds of nodes? Or thousands of them? Yes, these attacks are annoying. Yes, they can have a significant impact on online ventures, and on the businesses and projects they support; however, it is important to be precise about the nature of such an attack, and not to become histrionic in proclaiming that they might shake our democratic institutions to their foundations, or to mistake them for a more serious attack whose aim is to break into systems and extract sensitive information from them. Even good, thoughtful journalists can be caught up in the tumult, and can almost become annoyed at any attempt to play down the hysteria. One such journalist is the usually-excellent Stephen Bush, who wrote a piece for the New Statesman titled “What does and doesn’t matter about the cyberattack on Labour headquarters”. He begins by connecting perhaps one dot too many: The Labour Party’s website has come under what the party has described as a “sophisticated and large scale cyberattack”, which has re-ignited the row over the government’s delay in publishing a parliamentary select committee’s report into the scale of Russian attempts to interfere with the democratic process, both here in the United Kingdom and further afield. To conjoin alleged Russian interference with the DDoS attack against the Labour websites is tendentious. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Here, as so often, we might reach for Occam’s Razor. A few tedious “script-kiddies” represent a simple explanation which more often than not ends up being the correct one. We should rightly demand substantive justification for the inclusion of any John Le Carre-esque additional variables. Bush then claims that arguing about Labour’s use of the word “sophisticated” to describe this attack “badly misses the point” and diminishes the “importance of what happened”. No. A politician does not get a pass when they are flippant with language where the reasonable inferences are so severely acute. To any technically literate person, “sophistication” implies a very clear set of concomitant implications, and it is disingenuous to suggest otherwise. Imagine a layperson described a patient’s condition as “critical”. Imagine too that this adjective were used not out of medical precision, but as an impressionistic indication of that patient’s relative importance to that person. A doctor would be well justified in correcting that person if the technically accurate description of that patient’s condition were, in fact, “stable”. And, in this instance, as Bush points out himself, the “doctor” has spoken: The National Cyber Security Centre has classified the attack as a “category six”, the lowest tier of the incidents it deals with, while CloudFlare, the American infosecurity company that Labour employs to manage its cybersecurity, has thus far dealt with the attack very comfortably. Beyond the chaffe and bluster, this reveals that the attack is not one that would have any reasonable chance or expectation of accessing any data illegitimately. This is not a hack or a data breach. In its democratic significance, it is the equivalent, perhaps, of shouting with a loud-hailer on College Green when an MP is trying to give an interview in the vicinity. Annoying and potentially intimidating, yes; and it may even prevent temporary access to political information, but it bears no relation to a “break-in” or a “robbery”. Despite using his analogies of a robbery, Bush actually does confirm that this event was “a denial-of-service (DDOS) attack, a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator(s) tries to make a website go down by overloading its systems, essentially by simulating a website becoming incredibly busy by flooding it with requests from multiple sources”. Indeed. So what has this to do with “robbery” or data theft? Bush claims this level-headed description of what actually happened is, somehow, “a bit of a red herring”. He continues: The first relates to the way that launching a cyberattack is a lot like robbing a house. The second, paradoxically, relates to the ways in which launching a cyberattack is entirely unlike robbing a house. This attack was, in fact, neither a lot like robbing a house, nor “paradoxically” entirely unlike robbing a house. To quote Wolfgang Pauli, Bush’s ongoing analogy of this DDoS’s approximating a house burglary is “not even wrong”. Just because there are more or less sophisticated Denial of Service attacks, this does not mean that they are related to data-breaches. Furthermore, there are detailed technical reasons why some Distributed Denial of Service attacks are simple to thwart, and others are not. We shan’t dive into those technical reasons here, but, as Bush acknowledges, this attack was classified as the lowest tier of incidents by those in the know for good reason. Bush nonetheless persists in the unhelpful burglary analogy: It is like robbing a house in that, yes, a sophisticated burglar might be able to climb the five storeys of my flat, clamber onto the balcony, drill a hole through the window, crawl in and rob the place, but no matter how well-equipped a thief they might be, they are highly likely to check if the front door is unlocked first. This bears no relation to a Denial of Service attack. One might argue about the relative sophistication of a particular attack. To extend my earlier analogy, one might, for example, suggest that a loudhailer would be unnecessary to block out a College Green interview if the erstwhile interviewee happened to be, say, Iain Duncan Smith rather than an Iain of more stentorian output — say, Paisley. But in discussing whether a loudhailer was or was not used, again, we are not talking about any attempted robbery. We’re still in the realm of obnoxious shouting, hooting or loitering. Bush goes on to argue that just because a burglar breaks into one’s flat in an “unsophisticated” way, it does not mean they’re incapable of sophistication. And, again, this is a category error. A denial of service attack — and even a distributed denial of service attack — is trivially easy to orchestrate against any site. In an important sense, the most sophisticated DDoS is, by definition, unsophisticated. People can and do mitigate against them, but even so, they can have a devastating effect in bringing down a site; however, they do not, per se, have any relation to any data breach or “hack”. They are in no sense the “burglary” that is the potent point of Bush’s analogy. The ability to obtain data from behind a well-protected firewall is an utterly different proposition than obnoxiously throwing requests to a website whose raison d’etre is to accept such public requests. Indeed, the whole point of a well-orchestrated Distributed Denial of Service attack is that the requests strewn about by the attackers be indistinguishable from legitimate traffic because they are, in a sense, legitimate traffic, albeit maliciously launched. Sometimes, a DDoS is indistinguishable in effect and magnitude from something going innocently viral. In fact, the first such “attacks” were innocently launched. The once-popular technical site called Slashdot would post links in its stories, and its readers would click en masse on the links, interested in where they led, leading to the target site’s inability to cope with the sudden and unexpected surge of interest. Even today, this term is still sometimes called “the Slashdot Effect”. It’s the same problem as with a malicious DDoS: not enough infrastructure to deal with the requests made of it — whether those requests were instigated by shadowy Russians or as a result of a popular celeb’s tweet. At the company I run, we have to deal with these innocent issues daily. We manage some extremely popular sites. For example, when Stephen Fry sends a tweet that links to something he’s posted on his site that he hosts with us, we need to make sure that it can cope with the many thousands of curious fans who descend upon that post all at about the same moment. Thus, dealing with a potential avalanche of traffic is something any responsible platform manager has to anticipate, whether from friend or foe. Thus, it is a part of the “network normal” in a sense, which, again, differentiates it from an extraordinary attack on security infrastructure which causes a data breach or corruption. But Bush continues to attempt to draw comparison with just such a data-breaching attack. In fact, he brings up one of the most infamous examples in the last decade: The successful cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee in 2016, which has been repeatedly and credibly linked to state actors, was achieved through unsophisticated means: The recent report by Rober Mueller finds surprisingly little properly-coherent evidence of state actor involvement in the DNC cyberattack. Indeed, one of the more plausible technical explanations is that the mails were placed on a USB drive internally and then leaked. But that is another can of worms that nobody but those actually interested in technology — and, sadly, wild conspiracy theorists — is prepared to open. That John Podesta was idiotically lax in his digital hygiene is not in question. That the Labour attack was the first step in an attempt to gain illegal access to sensitive information is, oppositely, also not in question. Once more, a Denial of Service attack is not a phishing attack; nor is it any other act of data breaching. While the two can go hand in hand, they are not linked at the hip. Quite the contrary: it would be utterly counterproductive for someone who wished to orchestrate a data breach to begin it with a DDoS hors d’oeuvre. It would be the equivalent of a burglar standing outside a targeted house and singing Jailhouse Rock before he attempted to break in. Not conducive to an unobtrusive robbery. Bush continues to try to decouple the sophistication of the attack from the seriousness of the attacker. He suggests “a sophisticated cyberattack is not necessarily the work of a particularly sophisticated person or of a hostile state”. In some respects, he has a point, but in the real world, anyone who’s spent long enough dealing with network security knows full well that empiricism typically confirms this association of sophistication with seriousness of intent and actor. In computing circles, a brute-force attack launched with off-the-shelf bots that leave obvious signatures of their behaviour is not sophisticated. Quite the contrary. If this had been a data-breach, rather than an act of obnoxious obstruction, then its sophistication would have been notable by its not being known about until well after the event, if at all. The Labour Party attack was sound and fury, signifying nothing. Silent but deadly is the true mark of sophistication in the networked realm. Bush suggests, via off-the-record briefings, that a bespoke application that holds information about voters and their support of the party, was one target of the attack. This seems to be a garbled understanding of the events. If there had been substantive evidence of a specific attempt to obtain sensitive information therefrom then, by definition, the National Cyber Security Centre could not have allocated its lowest severity classification, which Bush admits it did. Perhaps some further evidence will emerge which will escalate the significance and severity of this event. But until an organisation like the NCSC is presented with such evidence, we can only go by the data that has been presented publicly. Bush concludes: What matters in this instance is that Labour’s defences held up pretty well — that’s the good news. The bad news is that someone, for some reason, has launched the first major cyberattack on a political party in the United Kingdom — and that the political discourse around what happened has been sorely lacking. That Labour’s defences held up pretty well was a testament to the triviality of this attack, and the ability of CloudFlare and others to deal with such trivial attacks. This is because “attacks” of this sort are quotidian for the likes of CloudFlare and the company I run — whether from friend (because of unexpected popularity) or foe. This was not then a major cyberattack on a political party that strikes at the core of our democracy, as some of the more lurid headlines of recent days have suggested. Nothing in the description of this DDoS attack suggests there were any worrying implications for data security. And, again, if they had, the National Cyber Security Centre would have had something to say about it. Nor was it the first such “attack” on a political website. It was an example of malicious behaviour that technologists have to deal with every day. It may have been launched at the behest of Vladimir Putin; or it may have been triggered by a constituent annoyed by their MP’s response to a request about wheelie bins. Mountains and molehills and other assorted cliches present themselves readily to any technically literate person who reads around this episode. Network administrators who spend their days and nights dealing with all that’s thrown at public sites on the Internet can only snigger at the pearl-clutching operatics evidence in some of the headlines. Some of the follow up by Bush himself, and by his Twitter followers, was similarly confused. There was even a brief side-discussion of the role played by “arts” graduates, and speculation as to the extent to which they could possibly even begin to understand the technical issues at play here. The UK in particular revels in a kind of technical illiteracy which has deep roots; it has connections to a gentry who long belittled those involved in science and technology as arrivistes. While the historiographical debates of the 1980s about Victorian attitudes to entrepreneurship, industry, and scientific innovation are somewhat hackneyed, there remains something undeniable in the fact that ‘The Classics’ (sic) were long-seen as an appropriate way to staunch a gentleman’s intellectual curiosity. Facets of this persist, where an interviewer like a Paxman or Humphrys can revel in a technical illiteracy that would embarrass them to admit in any other field. Sadly, this inverted snobbery has trickled down to a younger generation. As we all live in a networked world, the properly informed citizen now has the duty to educate themselves sufficiently to understand fully the threats — or otherwise — to their liberty in that networked world. And this means going beyond alarming analogies which hinder rather than help true understanding. And this knowledge is available to “even” arts graduates. I know, because I am one myself.

Garcia (Jason X) Follow -- Listen Share The day Mulhausen shot the CIO in weekly staff was also the day I ignored Blair all morning. Although she was pissed off and cannily antagonistic toward me for allegedly having sex with my wife, I pretended to be pissed off and cannily antagonistic toward her for no apparent reason. The more seemingly indignant I pretended to become, the more malleable and compliant she became while also being utterly confused as to why I was so pissed off and cannily antagonistic toward her. I don’t profess to understand it; I just know that this counter attack always worked. Whenever I ignored Blair, it always freed up my time considerably. Blair exhausted a great deal of my time at work. This was another reason there was no time to do my job at the office. Not that I really did anything anyway. And neither did any of the other executives at my corporation. Don’t get me wrong, I was no executive. But I acted like one, so most everyone on the business side believed that I was one. In reality, I was just a manager everyone thought was a director who was about to be promoted to vice president. Nothing was further from the truth. It all started when my direct boss was kicked out of the Company for not being difficult enough. If an executive is not oppressive and troublesome to everyone, including those above, something is unequivocally out of whack. In this case, the man was as pliable as Play Dough. Even I got everything I asked of him. When subordinates get what they ask for, you know you’ve got a serious breach in executive conduct. So they got rid of him. One day he was there, the next he was “pursuing other opportunities.” Upper management planned on a long and thorough executive search since this was a pivotal role and they had no intention of making the same mistake twice. And although it was a pivotal role, they felt the Company would operate just fine for many months with nobody in the position. Finding a difficult person is a difficult thing to do. In the interview, everyone always seems so pleasant and jocular; the kind of person you’d like to pal around with, not hire. It takes months and months of rigorous interrogation to get a person to show their true colors. And then, once a truly precarious candidate is identified, there will be subsequent months of negotiation on a contract and compensation package. A difficult person could draw deal negotiation out until the end of time. In the meantime, I took over the role of IT Director without the actual title, since someone had to do the job in the interim. It was very easy to do what my former boss did, since he, like all the other executives in the Company, did nothing. I didn’t realize how little he did until I had to do his job. And although I had more responsibility, I actually did less. And although I did less, I got credit for more. “Looks like you get a couch in your office now,” Katie Loveshak from Facilities said with a coy grin as she slouched buoyantly in the doorway to my office. I looked up and raised my eyebrows moderately as I awaited the punchline or at least further glib chatter on the subject, but there was none. She just continued to oscillate at my door and swell like a baking muffin top. That’s when I realized what was happening here. My boss was gone and I was suddenly doing the things he used to do which was as little as possible, so Loveshak from Facilities, and probably many others, assumed I was promoted to the newly vacated position. I was not going to lie about it, but I certainly wasn’t going to deny it. Especially if it got me a couch in my office. Sex on my desk after office hours during a volley of initial reckless passion was fine the first couple of times, but ongoing, a petulant couple really needed some semblance of comfort during the lurid act of adultery. A couch would work just fine, even if it was just a love seat — which is what Directors got. VP’s and above got a choice between a table with chairs or a full length couch. But who wants to sit at a table and talk when you could be fucking on a full length couch? “Great,” I said, slapping on a friendly face. “When will that be?” “Already ordered,” she said. “Should be here in a week.” Loveshak typically made no concerted effort to socialize at work because she was too busy mandating compliance with everything that even remotely related to Facilities. There was a friendly little sign everywhere that reminded us all of our communal responsibilities. Clean the microwave after use, make another pot of coffee if you finish the pot, keep what you want, but all food and drink in the refrigerator will be thrown out the first day of each month, and other rules of compliance. She even posted in the men’s bathroom above the urinals a sign that read, “Pay attention to your aim; the urinals don’t clean themselves.” I was surprised she didn’t mandate sit-down pissing like McKinney’s wife. “I understand why a woman would try to emasculate her man that way,” I told McKinney. “But I don’t understand why a man would comply.” McKinney shamelessly shrugged his lithesome shoulders. “My two boys do it too. It’s messy otherwise. Who wants to clean piss off the toilet? Sitting down is more relaxing. I don’t mind at all.” “It’s our right as men,” I said patriotically, “to pee on everything. You’re raising your kids to be earthy. Is that what you want? Earthy children?” “What’s wrong with Earthy?” “Earthy gets beat up at school, that’s what’s wrong with Earthy. Earthy doesn’t get the girl. The hot girl. Earthy pines for the hot girl but never gets the hot girl. Earthy writes poems expressing melancholy, morose, despondent, and depressing thoughts. Earthy becomes a serial killer. That’s what’s wrong with Earthy.” “You’re out of your mind.” “Not even Conklin’s wife makes him piss sitting down, and she makes him do everything. He does the laundry, he does the dishes, he cleans the house. And all she ever does is fuck everyone in the neighborhood.” “And Conklin also cleans the toilets. So what does she care?” “Do you piss sitting down at work?” “No, not here,” McKinney said as if the notion were utterly ridiculous. “You think I’m cleaning these toilets?” “Of course not,” I said. “Loveshak cleans the toilets. Or so we’re led to believe. She might very well like to have a conversation with your wife, and then look at the trouble you’d be in.” Loveshak worked for Bloom, Skeffington’s Office Manager. Skeffington was the CEO of the Division and had a predisposition to hiring either older or homely women on the administrative side with the exception of Charmaine, his executive assistant, who Penguined Kessler because Skeffington was too demanding. Loveshak fell in the homely category and smiled only occasionally with listless eyes and a plunging posture. She was not unhappy; she was just mechanical and indifferent. Once in a while, I’d be caught in the elevator alone with her and feel the need to make conversation. There was never a need from her point of view, but instinctively I’d initiate social interaction and regret it immediately. The discussion was always bone dry and lacking any real sense of humanism. She was a drone. Whenever this happened, with acute peripheral vision, I’d glare at the passing digitized floors as if that would make them pass quicker. The express elevator was never express during a conversation with Loveshak. But we all had our little challenges to overcome. “You’ll probably get a bigger office,” she said in a conspicuous timbre. “You only have 120 ceiling tiles now. That doesn’t seem fitting. You should have at least 180.” I never subscribed to counting ceiling tiles. Not my own, not in other offices. I was just glad to have an office and now I was elated to get a couch. -- -- Novelist/Screenwriter.

Fearlessly.  Edward James Herath Follow Flaneur Media -- Listen Share All the world’s a stage and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and entrances. William Shakespeare William Shakespeare eloquently describes the human condition in a famous passage from his play, As You Like It. We are all too often guilty of passing through life, as if we were players merely entering and exiting when it suits us. There is no escaping the unquestionable truth that human relationships are messy, demanding and seemingly fruitless. Ultimately though, they are rich, deeply intricate and most importantly, intimate. At this stage, it’s crucial to identify what intimacy is, and its significance in modern day society. It used to be so simple. We’d ask out the girl next door and be happily married with 2.5 children. Marriage was too vital an economic and political institution to be entered into solely on the basis of something as irrational as love — Stephanie Coontz: Marriage, A History. Now however, we marry for something more than mere companionship. We marry, because we’re seeking a soulmate. We marry, because we’re seeking our one true love — cue wedding bells, blue skies and eternal bliss! Well, let me burst that bubble for a second. Finding your soulmate in the age of instant connectivity is not easy. Writing in Modern Romance: An Investigation, the comedian Aziz Ansari seeks the counsel of psychotherapist Esther Perel, who tells him: Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship. But now we want our partner to still give us all these things, but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot, and we live twice as long. So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide: Give me belonging, give me identity, give me continuity, but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one. Give me comfort, give me edge. Give me novelty, give me familiarity. Give me predictability, give me surprise. And we think it’s a given, and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that. That’s a lot to ask from one person isn’t it? Coupled with that, are the contradictory sentiments that we live by today. We live with a deep ambivalence about other people: we should not let them hold us back, and yet love is the only law. Reconciling those two attitudes is not straightforward. In his books, The Happiness Paradox and Intimacy, psychologist Ziyad Marar beautifully espouses this modern day phenomenon: Modern consciousness is torn by contradictory demands: on the one hand to escape from others who may have too much power over our lives, our potent audiences (to be authentic and free), and on the other to embrace them (to belong, to feel justified, to be valued). We want to connect with others without losing or autonomy and to express our freedom without being isolated. The relationship between these needs is paradoxical because the expression of one conjures up the need for its counterpart. As we turn our backs on those who would shape our lives we risk alienation or narcissism and must face them again, and as we face them risk submergence and neediness, and so must be prepared to turn away; we are in perpetual oscillation when it comes to other people. We want to be with them and influenced by them, yet at the same time we need space to be ourselves and to pursue our own goals unhampered by their expectations and ambitions for us. So, what’s the answer to this seemingly unanswerable conundrum? Your phone. The unstoppable growth of social media, has ensured that human relationships can now be developed purely through digital means. Online dating, Tinder, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, WeChat, WhatsApp, Messenger … all these digital communication tools let us present the self, as we want it to be. We can essentially delete and clean up the parts of ourselves, which we deem unworthy or unsuitable, when presenting the self. Sherry Turkle, the American internet pioneer, recently spoke at TedX. At the event, she spoke about how social media is mutating the human condition. Real time conversations she stated, are being substituted by online conversations: We expect more from technology and less from each other and we are vulnerable because technology is replacing intimacy. When was the last time you struck up conversation, with a perfect stranger? Undiluted, honest and open to vulnerability, the emotional bonds that are formed in those one-off intimate conversations, however small, are what make us human. Social media and digital devices however, are numbing our brain’s emotional receptors. These highly complex and complicated emotional receptors are being short changed. Friendships are now so short term and finely tuned, that the intimate bonds of friendship are now just that … mere connections. Digital dopamine has replaced those long bursts of euphoria, which occur when meeting someone new. All we are left with are short, sharp, bursts of emotion which we care very little about. Turkle says: Technology is seductive when what it offers meets our human vulnerabilities. And as it turns out, we are very vulnerable indeed. We are lonely but fearful of intimacy. Digital connections and the sociable robot may offer the illusion of companionship without the demands of friendship. Our networked lives allow us to hide from each other even as we are tethered to each other. We’d rather text than talk. Digital devices and technology address the deep insecurity that lies deep within us; the fear of being alone. Technology gives us a means with which to feel constantly connected to our friends, without the demands of friendship. However, as technology replaces intimacy, the feeling of loneliness increases. Loneliness however, should not be confused with being alone, or solitude. Solitude is important to the human condition, as it allows us time to reflect and find ourselves. Finding yourself doesn’t always have to equate to talking. Talk too much and conversation becomes meaningless. If we are not able to find solitude, then we will feel even more lonely. Turkle makes a fundamental observation: If we don’t teach our children to be alone, they’re only going to know how to be lonely. When you observe kids, teenagers and young adults, the vast majority tend to be silent and staring at their phones, even though they are surrounded by their friends or potential lovers. The intimate bonds of friendship and potential intimacy remain, but have been replaced by a binary code, rather than real-time conversation. It is a sad reminder of the power that social media holds, over the generations of today. How do we then ensure that the art of conversation is not lost to us or to the next generation? We can make technology work for us, rather than being a slave to technology. Turkle says: Technology is making a bid to redefine human connection — how we care for each other, how we care for ourselves — but it’s also giving us the opportunity to affirm our values and our direction. What we can focus on, is how technology can lead us back to the real world, our real lives, our own communities and our own friends and lovers. They need us and without them, we would not be human. Without them and all the truly magical wonders that love and friendship bring, the art of conversation will truly be lost, forever. -- -- Storytelling.

These could be sites with exercises, devices that enable instructors to make new exercises, stages for case the board, or some other of a wide scope of administrations that are intended to support instructive chairmen, educators, and understudies. These devices can be an extraordinary method to cultivate advanced learning and construct significant aptitudes for 21st century students, yet it is essential to think about whether instructors and homerooms are prepared to execute them in an important manner. The SAMR model is a system intended to enable teachers to get a completely clear thought of what their objectives are for executing innovation, just as the particular results the innovation can give. SAMR is an abbreviation for the accompanying terms: Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition. We’ll get into what each term implies somewhat later on, yet it is additionally essential to comprehend that they are broken into two classifications. Substitution and Augmentation are both considered “upgrade”, while Modification and Redefinition are “change”. How about we make a plunge somewhat more profound into what each bit of the model really implies. The first and most effortless piece is substitution. This is the most essential type of innovation reconciliation in the SAMR model, and comprises of only supplanting a conventional exercise thing with a mechanical proportional. A case of substitution would utilize a powerpoint introduction to convey content, as opposed to perusing straight out of a course book. While substitution is the most essential type of innovation coordination, that does fundamentally imply that it’s anything but a profitable and significant approach to carry innovation into the study hall, and dependent on the separated needs of your study hall, substitution can be an extraordinary method to include innovation in your understudies’ everyday exercises. The following type of innovation coordination is Augmentation, which is fundamentally the same as substitution aside from that it gives a reasonable improvement to the understudy in the action. While substitution is an immediate equal (reading material page versus site page) expanding exercises with innovation implies that the innovation really enables more noteworthy figuring out how to happen than would occur with the conventional homeroom asset. Both of these are viewed as “upgrades” since regardless they pass on the material similarly, however can regularly carry benefits with them that grow the getting the hang of occurring for the understudies. They enable the understudies to take in the material similarly, yet with expanded achievement or in a manner that is simpler to actualize. Presently we’re going to discover somewhat increasingly about the ‘change’ pieces. Alteration is taking a customary learning task and altogether transforming it with innovation. A case of this would supplant a ‘foldable’ about the close planetary system with a mixed media introduction. While the learning task is comparable, the finished result and the learning task have both changed somewhat because of innovation being actualized. At that point, at last, there is redefinition. Redefinition is taking a conventional learning task and totally changing it such that would be inconceivable without innovation. For instance, as opposed to finding out about an individual from another nation, an educator may set up a video call for understudies with somebody from abroad. By utilizing innovation to change the learning task, the instructor is incorporating innovation in his or her study hall at the most astounding conceivable dimension. Special thanks to Parker Duwelius for the helping material. These two bits of the system are legitimately called “transformative” on the grounds that they change the manner in which the exercise runs, and the manner in which the understudies interface with the substance. While these are abnormal state approaches to incorporate innovation into the study hall, they are in no way, shape or form any pretty much significant than the “upgrades” of substitution and expansion. It is imperative to equitably choose where in the SAMR model your innovation bodes well for the results of your students.

Forging into the new year, whether you’re just getting into cryptocurrency, or you’re a veteran hodler, chances are good you’ve heard about the ripoff schemes plied by malicious actors. Part of the problem lies with a mixture of sophisticated methods used by scammers paralleled with a sentiment of urgency that comes from the fear of missing out. These factors conflate with misinformation campaigns designed to ensnare newcomers to the scene. One of the things throwing fuel on the fire is a basic lack of understanding. People who are just getting inducted into the scene often do not know how to manage public versus private keys, or which cryptocurrency exchanges are the right ones to set up an account at, and how to move their digital assets to a cold storage wallet. This basic lack of understanding means people are likely to ask questions, which makes them targets for malicious actors who use misinformation to socially engineer an attack. Another problem is that supposedly trustworthy sources of information often fail to weed out the scammers. For instance, compromised Twitter accounts, sometimes even those verified by the platform itself, have been known to successfully place promotional ads featuring links to known phishing scams. If people see an advertisement for a cryptocurrency scam as a promoted tweet, they will be more susceptible to believing that type of scam is legitimate; while they may not fall for it immediately, they may later reference that instance and fall for a different scam, misinterpreting the information from seeing a scam in a promoted tweet. One hopes that eventually this issue is something that will be managed from the inside out as cryptocurrency systems begin to scale outwards and compete with legacy remittance systems. Once that happens the user interface side is less likely to feature hexadecimal code keys which can be difficult for the human eye to differentiate from another. Until that day comes, you can continue to rely on security tools from MetaCert. After a significant mainstream boom in 2017, nearly every chat service and social media site was crawling with crypto scammers to the point where MetaCert had to take action. Shortly after MetaCert developed tools for Slack that eradicated the phishing on the platform, MetaCert CEO and Founder Paul Walsh accurately predicted that scammers would migrate to another platform; Telegram. Again, MetaCert sprung into action, and created a bot that identifies dangerous resources such as malicious URLs and cryptocurrency addresses associated with phishing campaigns. Today, MetaCert’s powerful tools allow users to easily differentiate between legitimate and dangerous resources at a glance. Phishing scams today are often difficult to discern from their legitimate counterparts. In one case a user would have need a microscope to identify a tiny pixel above character to differentiate the scam site from the real one. Other times scammers use automated systems to get a green lock signifying SSL certification on their phishing site, and consumers fall for that. The truth is, without a valid verification system, it’s practically impossible to tell at a glance whether a site is safe or not until it’s too late. MetaCert has verified legitimate web resources with a green shield of trust, seen by subscribers to the Cryptonite browser plugin. That means you’ll see the green shield of trust whenever you visit a verified cryptocurrency related website, social media account, wallet provider, and/or cryptocurrency exchange. In 2018 we continued to expand our database of over 10 billion classified uniform resource identifiers across over 60 categories thanks to the participation of our community and our hard working team. In 2019 we intend to expand our verification services beyond crypto to encompass sites also targeted by phishing scammers including mainstream companies, payment portals, and more. Soon the green shield of trust will also signify you’re safe when you’re buying things online, paying bills, or otherwise managing finances through online banking services, so you’ll always know you’re in the right place on the web. Remember, if the shield is black, that means the site hasn’t been verified and might not be trustworthy, so use caution. Your subscription to Cryptonite today will get you more than a year’s worth of safety. For the first 2,000 subscribers to Cryptonite we’re offering $150 in MetaCert Tokens, to be distributed following the end of our public sale. You’ll know right away if you’re one of the first 2,000 subscribers: To subscribe to Cryptonite now, follow these instructions. MetaCert is still beta testing our email security tool that is sure to revolutionize the way you see links in your email. Many phishing emails contain links, or images with hyperlinks. MetaCert’s email security tool uses a color coded system to warn you against known threats, or potentially malicious links. Every link that appears in your email will feature a shield beside it; if the shield is green you’re safe, and if the shield is red you know it’s a phishing link. Again, if the shield is black, that means the resource hasn’t been verified, and that you should use extreme caution clicking on it. Sign up for our email security tool for iOS today, and see how we’re changing the way people see links in their email. This report was brought to you by MetaCert.

https://medium.com/@Altoros.com/redis-ruby-230ad00eb168?source=tag_archive---------79-----------------------,Introducción,Written by Altoros Argentina🚀,Altoros Argentina🚀,No Author URL,N/A,12 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Altoros Argentina🚀 Follow -- Share Redis & Ruby Autor: Leonardo Tolosa En este artículo se hará una introducción a Redis, explicando sus características principales y profundizando con ejemplos de código cómo aprovechar algunas de ellas para resolver dos escenarios típicos que se presentan en varios tipos de proyectos. Este artículo hace énfasis en cómo aprovechar Redis desde aplicaciones Ruby, por lo que son necesarios conocimientos de ese lenguaje para comprender los detalles de implementación explicados, pero no es requerido para comprender cómo aprovechar esos features en otras plataformas. Hay un motivo específico por el que es importante que un desarrollador Rails conozca Redis, y se trata de Sidekiq. La mayoría de las aplicaciones Rails de complejidad mediana o grande necesitan algún tipo de procesamiento asincrónico, y la solución más común para ese requerimiento es Sidekiq. El servicio de Sidekiq depende de Redis, y es por eso que en muchos proyectos ya se dispone de un servidor de Redis. Teniendo en cuenta esta gran disponibilidad, tiene sentido aprovecharlo para algo más que Sidekiq. También es por este motivo que en los ejemplos de código en Ruby se usará la gema redis-rb, que es la misma que utiliza Sidekiq para conectarse con Redis. Esto evita agregar otra dependencia a un proyecto si en el mismo ya utilizamos Sidekiq. El código Ruby de las dos aplicaciones de ejemplo se encuentra en el repositorio público del proyecto. Una vez clonado localmente, se requieren algunas gemas para su funcionamiento, que pueden instalarse utilizando Bundler (con el comando bundle install). En la sección de cada ejemplo se explicará cómo ejecutarlos. También es necesario un servidor de Redis. Las aplicaciones intentarán conectarse a un servidor instalado localmente, accesible en el número de puerto por defecto (6379). El servicio puede instalarse localmente de distintas maneras pero se recomienda utilizar Docker, el proyecto ya incluye un archivo de Docker Compose con la configuración requerida, por lo que puede iniciarse un container con el servidor simplemente ejecutando el comando docker-compose up. En los ejemplos se explican varios comandos de Redis, que pueden probarse ejecutándolos manualmente en una consola interactiva de Redis. Esta consola se instala junto al servidor, puede iniciarse con el comando redis-cli. Redis es un sistema NoSQL de almacenamiento y procesamiento de datos, de tipo clave/valor (key/value storage). Eso significa que maneja estructuras de datos atómicas, cada una accesible a través de un key identificativo único, de forma similar a un hash. Al ser una base de datos de tipo key/value, y exceptuando unos pocos comandos particulares, Redis en general es incapaz de filtrar datos por su contenido. La funcionalidad disponible para buscar elementos almacenados es específica para cada uno de los tipos de datos soportados en Redis. Esto significa que para decidir qué tipos de datos de Redis a utilizar hay que tener en cuenta no sólo la estructura de la información a almacenar, si no también la forma en la que van a ser consultados. Además de esa funcionalidad básica de almacenamiento de objetos, ofrece varios tipos de operaciones posibles especializadas para cada uno de los tipos de estructuras de datos soportadas. En conjunto, esas operaciones constituyen una cantidad de features inferior a las disponibles en otras bases de datos NoSQL, de mayor flexibilidad, pero por su especialización es capaz de ejecutarlas con una performance muy superior. Si bien ofrece persistencia en disco, por defecto los datos son almacenados y procesados solamente en memoria, lo que hace que Redis tenga una performance muy elevada. La opción de persistencia a disco es configurable de distintas formas para obtener mayor o menor confiabilidad a costa de diferente impacto en la performance, pero ninguna es tan confiable como una base de datos ACID. Es por eso que no se recomienda utilizarlo como sistema de almacenamiento permanente de datos, pero sí para aprovechar su performance en procesamiento de grandes cantidades de información, o como almacenamiento de datos volátiles (tal como eventos, colas, métricas de performance, etc.) Los sorted sets son uno de los tipos de datos nativos de Redis. Cada sorted set se identifica con un nombre único, y cada uno contiene una lista ordenada de pares de valores. Cada par de valores está asociado entre sí, de forma similar a un hash (que también están soportados en Redis, como otro tipo nativo). Uno de los valores contiene un dato cualquiera que uno desee almacenar, y el otro es un valor numérico asociado que representa el ordenamiento de ese elemento dentro del set, denominado “score” (puntaje). Además de comandos básicos para agregar y quitar elementos de un set, hay varios específicos relacionados con el cálculo de posiciones y ordenamiento de sus elementos, tales como obtener el ranking de un elemento dentro del set (su número de posición en la lista ordenada), obtener valores dentro de un rango específico, etc. Este tipo de datos tiene la particularidad de que internamente en Redis la lista siempre se mantiene ordenada en memoria, por lo que listarlos o filtrarlos posteriormente por orden no tiene un costo adicional de performance (a diferencia de SQL). Es una operación de costo O(1), es decir de un tiempo constante de ejecución, independientemente de la cantidad de elementos que se encuentre dentro del set. Para ejemplificar esta funcionalidad se creó una aplicación simple de prueba, que resuelve un escenario común en muchas aplicaciones web. Se utilizará sorted sets para almacenar en Redis estadísticas simuladas de cantidad de visitas a distintas páginas web, para después obtener un ranking de las más visitadas. Típicamente estos valores se almacenarían en una base de datos relacionales (como un campo de cantidad de visitas en una tabla de artículos, por ejemplo), pero para sitios con mucho tráfico el escribir en la base de datos en cada pageview puede tener un impacto negativo en la performance de toda la aplicación. La implementación es una aplicación de Ruby de línea de comandos, definida en el archivo visits-ranking.rb en el repositorio de este proyecto. Puede ejecutarse directamente con cualquier intérprete de Ruby (con el comando ruby visits-ranking.rb). Al ejecutarse, en un primer paso se conecta con el servidor de Redis y almacena en el mismo los datos de 30.000 eventos simulados de pageviews distribuidos aleatoriamente en 1.000 páginas diferentes, cada uno conteniendo una URL de página generada al azar con el formato /articles/[id], donde id es un número aleatorio entre 1 y 1000. Tras cargar esos 30.000 eventos aleatorios en Redis, luego obtiene y muestra el ranking de las 10 páginas más visitadas y la cantidad de visitas de cada una. Resultados de una ejecución de ejemplo: Esta aplicación también muestra benchmarks básicos del tiempo de ejecución de esas operaciones. Nótese su elevada performance: ejecutándose en una PC de escritorio de rango medio (procesador Intel Core i5, 16 GB de RAM, disco SSD) es capaz de almacenar los 30.000 registros en un tiempo promedio de ejecución de 0.5 segundos, y obtener el ranking con el top 10 en menos de un milisegundo. Redis posee un conjunto de comandos para operar con sorted sets, veremos aquellos necesarios para resolver este problema particular. El primer paso es agregar los datos que necesitamos a un sorted set. En este caso, cada elemento en el sorted set es la combinación de una URL de una página (como dato), y su cantidad de pageviews como valor de score asociado. El comando más básico para agregar elementos a un sorted set es ZADD, que recibe como argumentos el nombre del sorted set, el dato a almacenar y su valor de ranking. Ejemplo: ZADD pageviews 1 /articles/42 En ese ejemplo, pageviews es el nombre del set, 1 es el rank (la cantidad de pageviews), y /articles/42 es el valor a almacenarse (el path de la página). El set no es necesario crearlo explícitamente por adelantado, se crea en el momento en que se le agrega un primer elemento. Para este ejemplo se almacenarán estos valores siempre dentro de un mismo sorted set llamado pageviews, pero para casos más avanzados puede ser necesario utilizar varios (separados por categorías, rangos de tiempo, etc). Para obtener luego el valor de score de una página se puede utilizar el comando ZSCORE (nótese que todos los comandos de sorted sets están prefijados con la letra Z). Recibe como primer parámetro el nombre del sorted set (como todos estos comandos), y luego el dato para el que se desea obtener su score (en este caso un path). Ejemplo: ZSCORE pageviews /articles/42 Para utilizar estos comandos para mantener un conteo actualizado de pageviews, en cada uno de los mismos habría que ejecutar ZSCORE para obtener la cantidad de pageviews para esa URL, incrementarla en 1, y luego volver a almacenarla con ZADD (por defecto sobreescribe un valor anterior si ya existía). Sin embargo, existe otro comando que permite incrementar el score de un valor y devolverlo en un solo paso, llamado ZINCRBY. Necesita los mismo parámetros que ZADD, pero en lugar de recibir un valor de score específico a almacenarse recibe un número a sumar al valor de un score existente (al funcionar como contador en este caso, ese valor es 1). Si el elemento no existía en el sorted set, es agregado al mismo con ese valor de incremento como score inicial. Este es el resultado de invocar ZSCORE seis veces en una consola de Redis, incrementado el score de dos valores diferentes (/articles/42 o /articles/43): 127.0.0.1:6379> zincrby pageviews 1 /articles/42 “1” 127.0.0.1:6379> zincrby pageviews 1 /articles/42 “2” 127.0.0.1:6379> zincrby pageviews 1 /articles/43 “1” 127.0.0.1:6379> zincrby pageviews 1 /articles/42 “3” 127.0.0.1:6379> zincrby pageviews 1 /articles/43 “2” 127.0.0.1:6379> zincrby pageviews 1 /articles/44 “1” Podemos observar que al ejecutar el comando incrementa el valor de score de un dato y lo devuelve, o si todavía no existía lo agrega al set con un score inicial de 1. Esto permite que si al visitar una página tenemos que incrementar su pageview y también mostrarlo en la misma, podamos hacerlo ejecutando un sólo comando. Una vez poblado el set con los datos, para obtener el ranking de las páginas más visitadas podemos utilizar el comando ZREVRANGE, que devuelve un rango de items ordenados descendentemente por su score (para obtenerlos por orden ascendente se utilizaría el comando ZRANGE). Este comando necesita tres parámetros: el nombre del set y el rango de elementos a obtener (expresado como índice inicial, contando desde cero, y un índice final). Opcionalmente puede recibir un cuarto parámetro WITHSCORES para que devuelva los datos y también sus scores asociados (por defecto devuelve solamente los datos). Ejemplo para devolver el top 10 de pageviews, con los valores obtenidos al haber ejecutado todos los comandos ZADD del ejemplo anterior: 127.0.0.1:6379> ZREVRANGE PAGEVIEWS 0 10 WITHSCORES 1) “/articles/42” 2) “3” 3) “/articles/43” 4) “2” 5) “/articles/44” 6) “1” Inversamente, para obtener el ranking de un dato específico podemos utilizar el comando ZREVRANK. 127.0.0.1:6379> ZREVRANK pageviews /articles/43 (integer) 1 El valor devuelto es la posición en el ranking empezando desde un índice de cero, por lo que un valor de 1 significa que es el segundo puesto. En este caso de uso, este comando puede ser útil para obtener y mostrar en cada página su índice de popularidad. La implementación de esta funcionalidad en Ruby es muy simple. El cliente de Redis incluido en la gema ofrece métodos para ejecutar cada uno de los comandos listados, con el mismo nombre y que recibe los mismos parámetros. Una vez instanciado un cliente, puede ejecutarse cada comando con facilidad a través del mismo. Ejemplos de Ruby extraídos de la aplicación: # crea instancia del cliente de Redis $redis = Redis.new # ejemplo de invocación de ZINCRBY $redis.zincrby ‘pageviews’, 1, path # ejemplo de ZREVRANGE ranking = $redis.zrevrange ‘pageviews’, 0, 9, with_scores: true El método zrevrange devuelve un array bidimensional, donde el primer elemento de cada par es el dato y el segundo el ranking. Si bien esta funcionalidad de Redis no está relacionada con el almacenamiento o procesamiento de datos, es frecuentemente necesaria en varios tipos de aplicaciones. Pub/Sub es el nombre de la funcionalidad que ofrece Redis para implementar sistemas de mensajería aplicando el patrón publisher/subscriber, que consiste en que los emisores de un mensaje (publicadores) puedan enviarlos sin necesitar un conocimiento específico de quiénes son los receptores (subscriptores), o de cuántos son ni dónde se encuentran. En lugar de establecer una comunicación directa entre los actores, los publicadores envían mensajes a un “canal”, una abstracción que agrupa tipos de mensajes compartidos entre emisores y receptores. A su vez, los receptores se “suscriben” a los canales de los que les interese recibir mensajes, sin necesitar tampoco conocimiento específico de quiénes son los emisores. Físicamente, los canales se encuentran en un servidor de mensajería compartido por los emisores y receptores, en este caso Redis, quien se encarga de recibir y entregar los mensajes. Este desacoplamiento entre emisores y receptores simplifica la implementación y permite una mayor escalabilidad. El paradigma es similar al de un message queue, pero más orientado a la entrega de mensajes en tiempo real. Esto es útil para varios tipos de aplicaciones que necesiten el manejo de eventos en tiempo real, tales como aplicaciones de chat, notificaciones de actividad en sitios web, envío de métricas de performance, etc. En este ejemplo se demostrará el uso de esta funcionalidad para implementar una aplicación simple de chat en Ruby. El código fuente de la misma se encuentra en el archivo chat.rb, en el repositorio de la aplicación. Puede ejecutarse con el comando ruby chat.rb. Es una aplicación interactiva de consola, que permite enviar y recibir mensajes a otras instancias de la aplicación, todas utilizando un mismo canal en un servidor de Redis. Al iniciar la aplicación pregunta por un nombre de usuario, que utiliza para identificarse en los mensajes enviados. Se une automáticamente a un canal predeterminado, donde envía todos los mensaje que uno escriba (al presionar ENTER), y muestra instantáneamente los recibidos desde otras instancias de la aplicación, junto al nombre del emisor. Para comprobar su funcionamiento, se deben ejecutar al menos dos instancias diferentes de la aplicación (puede hacerse ejecutándola en dos ventanas de consola diferentes, en la misma computadora). Para implementar esta funcionalidad, los comandos relevantes de Redis son SUBSCRIBE y PUBLISH. Al igual que en el ejemplo anterior, estos comandos de Redis se corresponden exactamente con métodos del mismo nombre en el cliente Ruby, por lo que serán descritos en la próxima sección. La gema redis-rb ofrece dos métodos para ejecutar los dos comandos de Redis relacionados con esta funcionalidad, PUBLISH y SUBSCRIBE. Veremos un ejemplo del código necesario para el emisor y el receptor de los mensajes (usualmente la misma aplicación, pero pueden ser diferentes). El código aquí mostrado fue extraído de la aplicación de chat de ejemplo, pero simplificado para su comprensión. En ambos casos, la variable $client ya contiene una instancia del cliente de Redis de la gema, inicializado de la misma manera que en el ejemplo anterior. Para recibir mensajes, la aplicación debe utilizar el método subscribe para ejecutar el comando del mismo nombre en Redis, que le permite suscribirse a un canal de un nombre específico (en este ejemplo, almacenado en la constante CHANNEL_NAME): $client.subscribe CHANNEL_NAME do |on| on.message do |channel, message| puts “#{channel}: #{message}” end end El método message acepta un bloque de código que es ejecutado cada vez que se recibe un mensaje en el canal suscrito, recibiendo en los parámetros channel y message el nombre del canal y el mensaje recibido, respectivamente. Ambas variables son de tipo string, por lo que si es necesario enviar una estructura de datos más compleja como mensaje se recomienda serializarla como JSON, y deserializarla en el receptor. Eso hace la aplicación de chat, pero en este código de ejemplo solamente se ejecuta el método puts para imprimir el nombre del canal y el mensaje recibido. Este código bloquea la ejecución del thread actual, por lo que si se necesita que continúe se recomienda ejecutarlo en un thread separado (eso también puede verse en el código de la aplicación de ejemplo). Del lado del emisor el código es aún más simple. Para enviar cada mensaje se invoca al método publish, que recibe como parámetros el nombre del canal donde enviar el mensaje y el contenido del mismo. Ejemplo: $client.publish CHANNEL_NAME, ‘Hello world!’ Redis es un base de datos con una funcionalidad limitada en comparación con otras soluciones de NoSQL, pero precisamente por su especialización puede resolver muchos escenarios con una performance y escalabilidad muy superior. Es muy simple utilizarlo desde Ruby, y al ser un requerimiento para ejecutar Sidekiq en muchos proyectos de Rails ya se dispone de un servidor de Redis, por lo que es conveniente saber cómo aprovecharlo. -- -- We are passionate about technology our main projects are related to blockchain, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and IoT.

We have carefully observed user behavior and listened to feedback to make sure we give our community the platform which empowers their dreams. Last month, we kick-started development for our re-imagined version, which we’re calling dreamr 1.0. We are so excited to talk about it. We are building fully native iOS and Android apps which will run on MongoDB and Node.js and will be deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The dreamr platform is divided into three core feature-sets: dreamr social (networking tools, dream connect, and dream-weaving), dreamr crowdfunding, and our P2P marketplace. Here is the detailed development roadmap for these features. Please note these features will be tested with small groups before public release: Updated on February 10, 2020 Here is an overview of the technical architecture of the dreamr platform. The dreamr platform will be powered by the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS, under which DRMR token and financial services will operate as directed by open source blockchain technology and smart contracts. The social network iOS and Android applications will be available first, followed by mobile web and desktop web solutions. These user-facing applications will utilize Experience Services for social transactions and dream declarations using GraphQL API, and node.js. The backend of the platform contains an internal dashboard with administration and reporting tools for the development team. The internal dashboard receives information from a stack of services, including Business Logic which includes both Experience Services via the dreamr microservice, java, and node.js, the Database Layer which includes the MongoDB, GraphDB, RDMS, batch jobs, and caches, and the Ethereum token service. Configuration Service will be used to push notifications to the apps through socket connection. Experience Service consumes data model from backend microservices and create a friendly view model for all user facing applications such as the iOS app, Android App, and mobile website. The Experience Service’s role is to move the logic from each front-end app to the service, which will result in writing less logic in the front-end and move the business logic and complexity to the service. Dreamr platform services are all broken down to small independent microservices. Microservices are small and modular services which are deployed independently and will communicate with other microservices. Batch jobs are script that run everyday to update database records with fresh content and ensure data consistency and integrity. Wallet services are planned to utilize the 0x Project (ZRX) API, allowing users to transact in their currency of choice in the marketplace. Dreamr Token Services is used to make calls and transactions to the Ethereum network. IPFS is a peer to peer hypermedia protocol and a cryptographic hash that will be used to store critical information such as book files and user information. IPFS is a great match for blockchain based software. We can store large amounts of data with IPFS and insert an immutable IPFS link into the blockchain transactions or smart contracts. This can secure and timestamp our content and transactions without having to put the data on the blockchain. Our hybrid solution creates a semi-centralized system. We chose to implement this solution to give end users a standard user experience on mobile devices, insulated from some of the complexity of current blockchain systems. We recognize that this approach has the drawbacks typical of a centralized system, such as having to rely on trust between participants. In the future, as technological advancements are made in distributed ledger technology and dApps, dreamr will migrate the transactional infrastructure to a fully decentralized solution that does not depend on dreamr or any other organization to function. Maintaining an enjoyable, low friction user experience is a top priority. Advances will need to be made in blockchain technology to enable scalable, low latency, and cost effective decentralized systems to eliminate the need for hybrid approaches in the development of business to consumer (B2C) applications. Dreamr welcomes the opportunity to work with the blockchain technology community on the necessary advances and using the dreamr platform as a means to test new technologies by integrating them into dreamr’s experience/transaction services.

And, for most people, that’s all it needs to be. But, virtually every electronic device in your home can potentially benefit from IoT integration, and Strawberry4Pi makes that as easy as possible to do with a Raspberry Pi. Strawberry4Pi recently launched on Kickstarter with the goal of providing an easy way to create Raspberry Pi IoT devices without doing any complicated programming or wiring. While many experienced makers can certainly build IoT devices already using existing products like the popular ESP8266 module, that kind of project would still be overwhelming to most tech enthusiasts. Strawberry4Pi is designed to be as streamlined as possible to use, so that even a normal home owner can give a device IoT functionality. The Strawberry4Pi board is made to snap right over a Raspberry Pi Zero W, and has four built-in mechanical relays. To turn a regular lamp into an IoT lamp, for example, all you have to do is run one wire through a relay. Then you can use the included smartphone app to switch it on and off, set timers, get notifications, and even share management of the device with friends and family.

Next up we want to congratulate the GreenPayCoin community on their big win in the latest round of the EvoNodes Free Listing Vote! As you can see from the final results below, they rallied together, gained the #1 spot, and never let go until they crossed the finish line! We already have 2 GPC nodes up and running! We have installed our Evonodes-Bot in the GPC Discord Server for easier access to the GPC Shared Masternode Pool. We look forward to supporting the needs of the GPC community, as well as the development team. On behalf of our team, Welcome to EvoNodes! In other news, we are happy to announce that we will be increasing our server cap once again! We will increase from 93 to 114! This means more room for new PRX, Reden, Kreds, & Stak nodes that have been waiting for this increase. This also means our node count will have a significant increase over the next week, most likely jumping to over 1100! Pretty crazy right?! It is all thanks to you, our loyal community members! We love you all! Lastly I have some bad news. PayCore, as well as SocialMediaCoin, are both going to be delisted. As some of you may know the devs were the same for both coins. Paycore had been around for a while, they had a solid community, and the developers were still active and communicating with us regularly. Right after they launched SMM coin, they have gone dark and have not responded to our direct messages on discord. Most services have already announced delistings for both projects. The SMM chain has completely died. We can not even send coins or process withdraws because the chain has stopped entirely. CryptoBridge has put the SMM wallet in maintenance mode, so coins can not be sold either. The PCR chain is still moving and we are asking all PCR investors to withdraw coins a.s.a.p! We will completely delist PCR at the end of the month, as long as that chain doesn’t die as well. We’ve tried what we could to get the SMM network running again, but there is nothing more we can do from our side. The blockchain reports zero online masternodes, which are required to keep the chain moving. In order to get masternodes set up however, the chain needs to move first. Without changes from the SMM team, it seems unlikely the chain will ever move again. Before we sign off for the week lets check out the stats. 1000 is proving to be a bit of “resistance”, but I have a strong feeling we are about to skyrocket past that, and then 1000 will become “support”! We will have many new features releasing over the coming weeks to look forward to. Stay tuned for the next round of voting to open up!

https://medium.com/@bez_3/the-value-of-conferences-3bc3c3378d23?source=tag_archive---------123-----------------------,The value of conferences,Written by Rebecca Boocock (Milgate),Rebecca Boocock (Milgate),No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Rebecca Boocock (Milgate) Follow -- Listen Share We’re well into Conference Season, just last week I returned from my third conference in a month. I’ve been sparked to write this after attending three and being questioned by my sister-in-law about why I enjoy going to conferences and why I would present at them. So here is a short piece on why I think conferences are incredibly valuable and my top tips to get the most out of them. Conferences are wide and varied in their aims, size, quality and value, and so it’s important to consider what you want out of the experience before purchasing a ticket. To give you a little context the three conferences I’ve been to this month were: Codeweavers Get Focused This was a small conference organised and hosted by Codewavers specifically for their customers. For me as a representative of Codeweavers and presenter, it provided a valuable insight into the automotive industry and the direction it is taking, along with a good opportunity to meet our clients outside a formal setting. I would recommend speaking or attending this to any of our clients, it’s a lovely event with honest and relevant insights shared (even if I do say so myself). CDX (Car Dealer Magazine Automotive Expo) A conference and expo dedicated to the UK retail motor industry. At this event, I was representing Codeweavers as a Sponsor at our stand, as well as presenting a talk on Data Insights with a colleague. It was a good event to make new contacts in the industry and was valuable for our Sales team with regards to Networking and leads. Women of Silicon Roundabout This is a sizable tech conference with a focus on diversity and inclusion, a lot of big tech companies, and thousands of attendees visit this event each year. This event and ones like it in our industry are incredibly valuable to tech professionals. I would recommend this event to anyone in tech but in particular ladies, as it’s wonderfully empowering to see just how many women are actually in tech! It’s also brilliant for anyone with an interest in improving diversity of any kind at there organisation, particularly HR and recruitment practises. I wrote a blog last year in fact if your interested in more about this event in particular. The three events I’ve attended are varied in size, intent, and audience, as well as the cost to attend and value to you. All were worth attending for me personally, and I got a lot out of presenting at the first two, which lead to numerous conversations on topics that really interest me. Conferences are not a substitute for training if you want to learn a particular skill, but they are very valuable experience in their own right, a considerable catalyst for ideas, and great for professional network expansion for you and your business. A good conference can and should teach you something new, and empower you to push yourself/your company. Top Tips 1. First and foremost ensure there is a relevance for you personally / professionally or your company before agreeing to attend or present. Conferences take you away from your day to day at work and usually at least one overnight, so they need to be worth your time. There are a lot of conferences in any industry so if you know someone who’s been, ask their thoughts. A recommendation can help to weed out the conferences that are of a poorer quality or less relevant, either in terms of speakers or attendees. 2. Plan ahead: This is particularly important if you are speaking. I won’t go into speaking further as that could be a blog post in its own right! But know your timeslot, your content, and any technical constraints you might face if you’re demonstrating software. 3. Plan your agenda, to start this ask yourself the following: 4. Leave time in your schedule to visit stands and Network! I can’t stress enough the value of talking to the other attendees, sponsors and speakers relevant to you and your company. These are valuable for information, and they are potential clients, colleagues or mentors you are speaking to. 5. Pack light: Conferences usually have loads of information and freebies for attendees to take away; industry magazines, company information packs, pens, notebooks and it seems socks are becoming popular at conferences now! Some of the info packs can be great to compare to your current company offerings and see where you can improve your market offering, recruitment practises etc. So in conclusion, it’s been a busy month! I’ve caught up with some of our clients I otherwise wouldn’t have seen this month, met some great new people, learnt new things about the automotive industry, furthered my personal development and got some great exposure presenting. Attending these kinds of events are not only great for sales and networking, but they are also great for keeping up to date with the latest trends in your industry and technology which continues to moves rapidly. So take the opportunity if it’s offered it, and ask for the opportunity to attend the right conference for you and your business if it’s not! -- -- Head of Delivery at Codeweavers Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*4CiO_qhqDma4yeBL0P6AWg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*4CiO_qhqDma4yeBL0P6AWg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*4CiO_qhqDma4yeBL0P6AWg.jpeg"
https://medium.com/@IBMResearch/artificial-intelligence-drones-and-sensors-set-to-save-our-crumbling-infrastructure-c4152a27d78f?source=tag_archive---------20-----------------------,"Artificial Intelligence, Drones and Sensors Set to Save Our Crumbling Infrastructure",Written by Inside IBM Research,Inside IBM Research,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Inside IBM Research Follow -- Listen Share By Katia Moskvitch Infrastructure fails. The buzz about flying taxis, futuristic high-speed vacuum tunnels and even autonomous cars apart, in real life essential infrastructure is ageing around the world, with bridges, motorways, dams and tunnels cracking at the seams. It’s a challenge that exceeds the capacity of any maintenance department. However, new artificial intelligence technology from IBM Research and partners combined with data collected from drones and sensors can help save the day — and patch the cracks in time. In the United States, one in 13 bridges is considered structurally deficient — which means it has a significant defect that needs urgent repairs or at the very least less weight and reduced traffic speed. That’s 47,052 bridges out of the country’s 616,087 — and, according to a recent report, Americans zoom across these failing bridges 178 million times every single day. And it’s not just bridges — concrete cracks on motorways and potholes impact the smooth goods delivery, affecting the economy. Tunnels collapsing can trap traffic inside and stay unusable for months or years, leading to congestion on nearby roads, and dams failing can trigger floods. But spotting cracks in time on miles and miles of highways and countless bridges is not just costly and time consuming, but plain tricky. Enter AI — and drones. Drones take pictures, lots of them. While it can take a human team a month to examine a pillar of a large bridge (and they have to do it while dangling precariously using ropes and harnesses), a drone can zip around in just a day. Usually, drones are controlled by a human operator — but IBM researchers in the company’s Haifa lab in Israel have developed an automated navigation system that enables drones to fly totally autonomously. Once programmed, they navigate around a structure and snap pictures of cracks. An AI system developed by IBM scientists in Zurich then analyzes the images to spot any potential problems and alert humans to investigate up close. Apart from saving time and making the inspection process safer, another key advantage is that the drones take pictures always from the same angle and distance, instead of different people taking photos with a different perspective. This way, it’s then possible to compare the pictures, inspection after inspection, and monitor the progress of cracks over time. But it’s not just about the drones. IBM is collaborating with Sund & Bælt, the owner and operator of some of the largest infrastructure in the world, and with Sacertis, an Italian firm that has developed a sensor-based monitoring system for bridges, roads and other infrastructure. The three firms are working jointly using several technologies: the drones that automatically collect high-resolution images at regular intervals, the AI for image interpretation and document understanding— and sensors inserted in structures to spot internal problems. Using IBM’s AI, Sacertis has recently analyzed the images a drone took of Europe’s longest suspension bridge, Storebælt. It’s the third-longest suspension bridge in the world, linking the eastern and western parts of Denmark. The software hasn’t flagged any major defects that need urgent attention, says Andrea Cuomo, the founder of Sacertis, but it did find cracks. “Cracks are intrinsic in concrete, and there is probably no concrete structure in the world that doesn’t have them,” he says. “But there are cracks you don’t care about and there are structural cracks undermining the stability. It means that the earlier you close the cracks, the better — as over time, humidity can get in and undermine your structure.” With Storebælt images, the AI has been able to differentiate between cracks, an algae, and rust with 94 percent accuracy, says Dr. Cristiano Malossi, an IBM AI scientist leading the team that has developed NeuNetS, the platform for AI Automation. The accuracy “could potentially improve over time when we will get more data — we expect to have better AI models in the future,” he adds. Integrating this approach with mathematical models, sensor-based monitoring systems, data analytics and advanced civil engineering knowledge allows the structural engineer to assess the stability of the structure much more precisely — as well as to estimate the life span and provide the necessary data to plan predictive maintenance. The next step is to train the AI to differentiate between critical cracks and non-urgent ones. Over time, concrete ages — and many structures were built half a century ago or longer, designed for lighter loads than we have today. The software needs to analyze the stiffness, the safety of the structure and the load — and assess the risk. The IBM’s AI can’t yet determine which cracks are critical and which ones are cosmetic — at the moment, humans need to make the call. But the tech will get there soon, says Cuomo. “We will train the machine to understand what is critical and what is not, what was the structure and how was it built.” Sensors and image recognition can help set the right priorities in future interventions — and monitoring digital twins for years is arguably easier than trying to survey every single bridge. After all, Cuomo says, “you can’t repair 1000 bridges all at once, or you’ll close the country.” -- -- This is the official Medium account of IBM Research.

But today…this is the day. I am ready for a change. This will be a work in progress, a collage of impressions, ideas, and a recollection of the avenues I’ve traveled designing, architecting and implementing solutions, mainly in the Microsoft .NET stack, usually having to do with systems integration.

https://medium.com/@saishav_io/why-i-actually-quit-my-full-time-job-2b2ab73b3038?source=tag_archive---------148-----------------------,Why I prefer contract/task-based work over full-time jobs,Written by Saishav Agarwal,Saishav Agarwal,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Saishav Agarwal Follow -- Listen Share Firstly, this story isn’t as dramatic as you might expect it to be. My decision was instigated by one logical choice followed by another which made me realise that full-time jobs weren’t the way to go for me. Ever since I got into the corporate world, I was made to believe that I needed to have a full-time job. Full-time jobs guarantee job security, regular income and lots of perks, they said. It gives one a chance to learn new things and the company takes good care of employees. That was enough for me to get sold to this idea. It all sounded great. Every passionate software engineer only has one core requirement while looking for a job — to work on an interesting project. Something that helps solve one of the many problems that we have around us today, with the ultimate goal of making life better for us humans. After working at 2 full-time jobs over 3 years, I realised that I wasn’t developing (professionally) as much as I should be. Reason 1 — Job security that full-time jobs offer. This puts most people in a comfort zone which they never want to get out out. Hence, they don’t push themselves as much to achieve more. Reason 2— Work timings on most full-time jobs. Work timings are typically day-based. This requires you to work from 9am-5pm or similar hours to complete your work. But what if you’re more productive in the evenings or late nights ?! Most workplaces don’t offer such flexible working hours. Reason 3 — Work location. Again, most companies have a fixed location where you get allotted a desk. And a spell — ‘May all great ideas for this individual flow at this desk’. Seriously! Human beings need a change in environment from time to time. The greatest ideas come when you least expect them. Reason 4 — Tech Stack. Generally, a company has a particular tech stack and sticks to it for a few years. This is understandable as there is a cost associated with changing/upgrading to new technologies and that doesn’t always happen. Quite often it’s difficult to be in the same company and be updated with the latest out there. These reasons instigated me to try out contract roles. I came across a role that was close to what I wanted (without explicitly looking for one). Straight after joining, I was working on projects with teammates across the globe which was exciting. I was able to work whatever hours we wanted. Work was remote! Work from cafes, bars, libraries, home or a co-working space. I could travel around for a few weeks and still work. I tried all these and they all have a different feel to them. To be honest, this arrangement didn’t work straight away. Like anything it required getting used to the routine, getting out of the comfort zone I was in. Initially it felt like I was working alone, and it wasn’t exciting. This is when I joined a co-working space and it really worked in my favor. I was meeting new people, making new connections and also ended up collaborating with some. Work flexibility was not only great for efficiency but also to get non-work related stuff done. I could organise tennis matches during the day and work evenings sometimes. I was able to manage my time myself. I didn’t need a company to manage it for me. There were less meetings and less distractions in general. To top it all, contract roles pay well. And the best part is that I am in control of my money. Then came the next question — 1 year into a contract having worked on a couple of interesting projects and learnt enough, what do I do now? See if the company has a project you’re interested in. It doesn’t? No worries.Take a break and then move on to another contract. I have to mention here that the phase of life I am in (single with no dependents) was a big factor that contributed to me enjoying contract work. If I had just started a family having a full-time job could be a better option for multiple reasons. All in all, for anyone in the tech industry who is not sure about taking on a contract job, I would highly recommend considering it. I agree that it isn’t for everybody and that full-time jobs have their advantages. But there’s no better way to know than to try and see which one works better.

Technology like most things in life have their positive and negative effects. Recently, our founder introduced a concept that really got me thinking- earphone free afternoons in the office. The aim of this is to increase the inter-personal connection among us at the office. Seeing as most of us are millennial's, it was about time. In an era where friends meet up but they all end up being on their phones the entire time, the office space can have double of this effect seeing as we all have our laptops, earphones and phones. However, technology can help you increase your productivity. Here are a few ways tech that can help you increase your productivity. Traffic especially in big cities tends to take a lot of your time on your commute. If you happen to live in Nairobi like me, then you ought to have experienced traffic on either Thika Superhighway, Mombasa Road, Ngong’ Road or on University Way. Whether you are using private of public means, there are several ways you can use this time to be productive. My personal favourite is listening to podcasts. Podcasts offer an awesome learning opportunities. My current favourites are Jesus and Jolloff, Girl Boss Radio , Digital Marketing Podcast, Power Hour and Chini ya maji podcast. Audio books and language learning apps are also great ways to learn on the go. 2. Using Ad Blockers Sometimes you are going about your work then an ad pops up midway. Before you know it, you are shopping online or watching your 100th cat video on YouTube and guess what? You are a dog person. The best way for you to avoid these kinds of distractions is by using AdBlockers. 3. Timers There are days I have found myself to spending more time than necessary on a task that required probably half the time. Different Apps have brought this to life. My personal favourite is Forest. You input your estimated time and while you do your task the app runs on your phone while trees grow depending on how long you have taken without using other apps on your phone. 4. Habit Tracking Previously, it was believed that for you to form a habit, it takes 27 days or 30 days. However, that has come to change with recent research showing that it takes 66 days. Seeing as the time-frame has more than doubled, habit tracking apps have become a necessity. Whether you are trying to work out, journal, meditate or wake up at 6 am, these apps come in handy. My personal favourite is Journal it! It works for me as one of the key habits I have been trying to build is journaling. You can include other habits and it tracks them by colour coding them. 5. Collaboration at the work place Team work makes the dream work! Working spaces have changed drastically where you do not have to be in the same space physically for you to work together. Even though you work in the same physical space, digital platforms have helped reduce the time for assigning tasks and checking progress. At Impact Africa Network, this model has worked really well for us thus far considering that at times we are in different physical locations .The most used platforms are Trello , Slack and G-suite apps. “Productivity is never an accident.

Whether it be iPads in the classroom or phones playing “Baby Shark” at the dinner table, these influences have penetrated far and wide into the educational and personal lives of children. However, it is not often that we stop to think about the impact that technology has on the young brains of our future leaders. We are quick to think that allowing kids to watch YouTube videos and play games on these devices will help keep them quiet and focused during the times we need some quiet and peace in our lives. But what if I told you, those 20 minutes of peace and quiet are coming at a cost that is detrimental to the brains and minds of these children? We, as the protectors of these future generations, must be mindful about shielding them from the biggest, yet most stealthy predator they come to face: technology. You might be thinking, “What’s the big deal?” The “big deal” is that technology in the form of iPads, mobile phones, and just about anything you can imagine provides an endless source of distractions that strays away from children’s focus on daily life. Rather than doing much more productive activities, such as playing sports or reading, they are spending a copious amount of time paying attention to YouTube videos or games. Even when used in an instructional setting, technology tends to decrease the amount of information absorbed and actually creates more opportunities for distractions through attempts at multi-tasking by checking social media, web surfing, etc (1). By spending so much time living in the digital world, kids and adults alike miss out on a lot of the important things that happen around them. Not only that, but the younger the age that children are exposed to such technology, the more likely they are to have changes in their brain pathways and structure. At young ages, the brain is going through immense neural pruning, which is a process used by the brain to weed out unimportant pathways and strengthen ones that are used more often. During this process, if a child is exposed to more technology, it has been shown through neural screening that their executive functioning is impacted heavily (2). Executive function involves working memory, which is used in a variety of tasks, such as following instructions and paying attention. Exposure to technology during this time period prunes the pathways that are in charge of executive function and ultimately impairs it. A number of studies have been performed to show this effect. One of the more famous studies, also named the “Spongebob Study,” had four year old children watch the cartoon for about 10 minutes. That 10 minute time period was sufficient in creating deficits in executive function. Equally as important, another study showed that teens addicted to the internet also showed abnormal neural pathways indicative of impairments in executive function (2). Though it’s hard to extrapolate this data into long-term effects, it is more than likely that the findings are significant. Additionally, with the increasing use of technology at younger ages, kids begin to make associations that being “bored” is abnormal. This not only shortens their attention spans by a mile, but it also creates impulsive, inattentive, and impatient children (2). A study completed by the Pew Research Center in 2012 concluded the same findings as well. They surveyed teachers and found that 87% of them agreed that with an increase in technology use in the classroom, they found children to have shorter attention spans and had a harder time focusing even while using technology to administer educational tasks because kids were always expecting something interesting to happen. When assignments and homework became even a little bit uninteresting, they were not able to sit down and work on it for long periods of time. With all of these studies and brain imaging done, it is safe to say that the influence of technology on children and even adults has been unforgivingly dangerous. In fact, even the creators of these electronic devices condone a low-technology lifestyle. The highest paid engineers in the Silicon Valley send their children to no-tech Waldorf Schools, and even the notorious Steve Jobs also enforced such rules on his own children. Isn’t it ironic? Even worse, further brain imaging studies have shown that electronic devices, such as iPads and gaming consoles, have become a drug to kids in the digital form. These brain imaging studies are showing that they affect the brain’s frontal cortex, where executive functioning happens, in the same way that cocaine does. Technology hyper-arouses dopamine levels, which is a hormone that enforces rewarding behavior (i.e. using technology or even drugs) to establish an addition paradigm in a similar fashion to using drugs or even having sex (3). So why do we continuously allow kids to spend hours upon hours on iPads and gaming devices? Parents have an intuition that technology could be damaging to their kids, but they still choose to let them watch videos and play games due to the fact that they are able to quiet them down for some time. It is time, however, to realize that this can do more harm than good and we cannot be selfish in this sense. If your child or a child you know is whining and saying they’re bored, instead of throwing them an iPad or phone, maybe it’s time to lace up those running shoes and go for a walk, or even pull out a book and practice reading together. We need to take steps in reducing screen time, and increasing time connecting with these children and the world around us in order to avoid a future of children who have short attention spans and impaired higher cognitive functioning.

Where with technological sophistication, smartphones can be used more freely, even can be one of the fulfillment of human needs. In addition, the smartphone has also been equipped with various advanced features that can be accessed only by using internet services and installing certain applications on the user’s smartphone, so that it can be used in accordance with the wishes of the users. Along with the development of smartphone technology is also said to satisfy the style of the user, which is evidenced by the many users who buy branded smartphones at maximum prices, even though when viewed further the smartphone also has the same function as smartphones in general, which only have insignificant differences. Of course, because of the millennial lifestyle requirements that encourage companies to produce smartphones with advanced features without thinking about the quality of the smartphone. So that there are still many parts of smartphone products currently that are easily damaged, which is different from smartphones that were produced earlier with high quality and not easily damaged. In addition, the various applications used by users will automatically fulfill the smartphone’s internal storage, moreover each application requires an update so that it will use a lot of storage media. Where this will result in users having to replace their smartphone with a smartphone that has internal storage or Random Access Memory (RAM) is greater. Users do not need to replace the smartphone every time the users ‘RAM is full, which now comes with the Blockchain technology X platform which will provide a solution to users’ complaints. Where the platform is a platform that can provide smartphone products with advanced technology, large storage and can be designed according to the tastes of the users. In addition, the platform will also become a modern Blockchain internet in the future, where by using the internet, every application, image, data, bit and byte on the internet will be decentralized. So that with a decentralized system it will automatically stop various acts of crime that are rife in the era of the traditional internet today. Why is the traditional internet so often hacked or hacked by irresponsible technology activists? Where this can happen because the system used by the internet today can be seen directly by the client-server, so that it will make it easier for hackers to tap HTTP and DNS. Of course this is the problem for users, which users do not have full security when using the internet network. Therefore, Function X is present as a solution provider for every problem that is happening to the services provided by ordinary smartphones, such as limited storage and smaprthones that are easily damaged. Where Function X will issue a product called Blok On Blok (BOB), which is the first smartphone model released by Function X, so it can be designed according to the wishes of the users, and also has Snapdragon 660 specifications, 6 GB + 64 GB. Not only that, BOB will also be equipped with dual mode, which with dual mode users can switch from Blockchain phones to Android OS easily and can be accessed quickly. In addition, the smartphone will also be equipped with a design inspired by the Retro-Futuristic Sci-fi design which will be combined with the technological sophistication of the front like avant-garde. Not only that, BOB will also be equipped with a MOD kit assembly, which includes the core components of smartphones, such as the Motherboar, display screen, buttons, some audio speakers, 3D images that will complement the design of the user to become more real. In addition, to facilitate the users in assembling BOB smartphones, the Function X platform will complete a video tutorial about the assembly. Smartphones can also have a negative impact on users, which is a bad impact born of the convenience offered by smartphones. Where one of them makes the user become a person who has a high level of laziness because it is spoiled with a variety of technological sophistication, so that it will cause slowly blunt one’s creativity. Therefore, the use of BOB can hone the creativity of the users without reducing the sophistication of the technology used.

https://medium.com/@herc_token/using-hercules-blockchain-based-software-to-gain-supply-chain-efficiencies-152becdfd603?source=tag_archive---------130-----------------------,Using Hercules Blockchain-based Software to Gain Supply Chain Efficiencies,Written by HERC Token,HERC Token,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in HERC Token Follow -- 1 Listen Share The global supply chain consists of numerous, interconnected value chains. To achieve optimal supply chain efficiencies, more businesses need to rethink their supply chain network designs. Hercules’s team recognizes the current state of global value chains can be made more efficient by the application of blockchain supply chain technology. To give some perspective into the kind of impact a blockchain-based, supply chain protocol like Hercules can have, according to the European Commission: “Success in the intensively interacting new world economy depends on enterprises’ ability to access international markets and exploit global value chains.” International production and trade are largely organized within global value chains, where different stages of production processes are geographically dispersed. Companies attempt to optimize their production processes by locating various stages of their production process across different geographical sites. These stages include anything from design and production to marketing and distribution. Cross-border, production-sharing solutions that facilitate connectivity and flexibility across differing software solutions or interfaces are complex and sophisticated. Efficient, transparent and cost effective supply chain solutions are key to improving the state of global supply chain networks. Advances in decentralized models and open source software applications, particularly those integrating blockchain technology, are starting to be incredibly effective in connecting applications and programs, as well as people and teams, into more cohesive planning and execution funnels along these global supply chains. According to a study conducted by Aberdeen Group, an international market intelligence company that collects and analyzes data on buyer behavior across 200+ B2B sectors, “… top-performing companies that implemented supplier performance management initiatives have achieved average cost savings of around 12%.” As we navigate the digitized era in supply chain management, the challenges faced by manufacturers and logistics providers are becoming increasingly complex and their legacy information silos are operational burdens. In 2007, AMR Research (now Gartner, Inc.), an independent US research and industry analysis firm focused on global supply chain best practices and all supporting technologies, released its “Supply Chain Top 25.” What the report showed: the average total returns of the 25 companies featured was 17.89%, compared with returns of 6.43% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 3.53% for companies in Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Now, the number of companies looking at supply chain automation is estimated to grow. A 2014 survey by Deloitte revealed that 79% of businesses with high-performing supply chains achieve revenue growth greater than the average within their industries. A PwC survey of 400 retail CEOs found that 83% believe that their supply chains are not ready for the challenges of omni-channel commerce. Companies with well-run supply chains continue to outperform other companies and greater efficiency is seen in integrated supply chains compared to those that are not integrated. In essence, better managed supply chains mean better ROI. An integrated supply chain can lay the foundations for increased visibility, better supply chain management, increased responsiveness to new technological adoption and innovation for the purposes of enhancing processes such as production sequencing, product customization, freight scheduling and inventory management. The Hercules Blockchain Supply Chain Protocol, with its integrated human verification and validation tool HIPR, is designed to enable streamlined and holistic supply chain management functions. The Hercules Protocol is live and many well-known companies are starting to use the blockchain software in some aspects of their businesses. Helmsley Spear Real Estate Company, for instance, is using Hercules Blockchain Supply Chain Software to manage its rent rolls in two of its commercial buildings in Lower Manhattan. Helmsley Spear’s owner and president Kent M. Swig states that “typically, people misunderstand in thinking blockchain is just a public way of identifying information.” However, his firm is using it for proprietary and confidential information. He notes, “The security on blockchain is very strong and very good.” The pricing model, which factors in small-scale and commercial protocol usage, allows for sustainable storage and scalability frameworks to be integrated into the core technology. Hercules protocol writes information on to blockchain at a rate of approximately $.32 for 10,000 entries. In addition, Hercules uses Factom at the rate of roughly $.32 for 10,000 entries as well as the cost of Ethereum (estimated at $20–40 per 10,000 uses). Hercules also uses Storj to store pictures, documents or videos at a rate of about $.02 per GB. HERC software key price is based on a volume weighted average price ‘of all secondary and direct market HERC token price information’. Hercules is constantly being augmented for improved public blockchain network interoperability and digital supply chain capabilities to boost efficiency and, by extension, profitability for small businesses and enterprises alike. Multinational corporations have been on record attributing their success sometimes mainly to supply chain efficiencies, as confirmed by Dell, which once put out the statement: “The biggest leverage point we have is supply chains.” Even clothing manufacturer and retailer Zara has commented that their supply chain is basically their business model. It is not surprising then that a real correlation can be drawn between company’s financial success and the depth or sophistication of its supply chains. Legacy planning and operational platforms are no longer an efficient way of managing supply chain ecosystems since they are slow to adapt. They do not have the capability of supporting complex supply chains that have more variables and are continuously shifting and adapting to evolving market demands. Growing businesses today means incorporating more stakeholders and being able to be responsive. The Hercules Supply Chain Protocol solution not only helps eradicate racketeering and collusion, it also helps eliminate redundant paper-based processes, optimize and streamline value chains to ensure more reliable chain-of-custody and effective supply chain tracking while enhancing overall user experience.

https://medium.com/programming-leadership/building-good-relationships-are-the-key-to-everything-you-want-81aba5783071?source=tag_archive---------95-----------------------,Building good relationships are the key to everything you want,Relationships Matter,Marcus Blankenship,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Marcus Blankenship Follow Programming Leadership -- Listen Share When it comes to building high-performing teams, your relationship with your developers is more important than their technical skills. While technical skills are important, strong developer–manager relationships are the keys to everything you want. Healthy relationships among employees and leaders produce high levels of engagement, motivation, trust, and transparency. These relational attributes are the foundation for an environment where your developer’s job performance and job satisfaction are at their highest. Most of us leave work relationships to chance, hoping that they flow naturally from personality matches. Good leaders can’t afford to do that. Instead, we must create systems that build strong individual relationships with all of our developers. When we build strong relationships with our developers, we enjoy distinct competitive business and technical advantages. Higher quality software, deeper domain knowledge, greater productivity, improved teamwork, and lower turnover are just some of the benefits that flow from these relationships. [SPONSOR] Learn how to save hours of time from countless meetings and one-on-ones with Humble Dot. When I ask technical leaders, “What is your hardest problem at work?”, I regularly hear problems such as… These aren’t technical defects, software scaling issues or problems with architecture. They’re problems reflecting poor relationships between managers and developers. Developers “stuck in outdated ways” or who won’t “get on board with the process” aren’t simply being stubborn. They’re experiencing internal fear or hesitation about their environment that makes them resistant to change. As the manager, it’s your job to create relationships and environments where it’s safe for them to grow and adapt and to coach them to take risks (such as trying your new-fangled processes!). In short, these problems are symptomatic of relationship issues, not technical or process issues. A recent Gallup report, The State of the American Manager, confirms that manager–developer relationships are the key to success: “managers account for at least 70% of the variance in employee engagement scores” and “50% of those surveyed have left a job to get away from a manager at some point.” Those numbers are staggering. They go on to report that “just 30% of U.S. workers are engaged, demonstrating a clear link between poor managing and a nation of ‘checked out’ employees.” Early in my career, I saw developers “checked out” of their work, but didn’t understand why. I mistakenly blamed them when I should have looked in the mirror. As Gerstner and Day wrote in the Journal of Applied Psychology, “The relationship with one’s boss is the lens through which the entire work experience is viewed.” That’s a huge statement. Have you considered that your developer’s view of the company, projects, goals, process and everything else flows from their relationship with you, and that building a great relationship is primarily your responsibility? If the relationship is good, it builds loyalty, motivation, and trust. But when it’s bad, nothing else can be right. You can’t have the right process and the wrong relationship. You can’t build great systems with the wrong relationships. Consider Conway’s Law: groups create software systems that mimic the communication structure of the group. This means the output from your team reflects the communication structure and relationship you have with them. For example, when teams under me didn’t trust their leaders or peer groups, their API interfaces were built to be “defensive” and loudly proclaimed to the caller that if an error occurred it was not the programmer’s fault, but rather must be a mistake on the caller’s end. This reflected the team’s “cover your butt” attitude, adopted in response to being unfairly blamed for problems in the past. This fear of blame displaced their trust in leaders or peers and was reflected in the software they wrote. So what is “engagement”? What do engaged developers look like? Here are some examples from my own experience. Engaged developers… For me, those six non-technical attributes are keys to being a great developer. Though developers get credit for having these attributes, it’s up to you, as the manager/leader, to engage your developers and create an environment where engagement thrives. This is the most important work you can do and will have the largest impact on your team and projects. Most of us allow our business relationships to grow and change without structure or focus. As a manager, you don’t have this luxury. You probably have great relationships with at least some of your developers. I’m guessing that the ones with whom you have the best relationships are naturally matched to you in personality. There’s a good chance that you’d be friends even if you didn’t work together. However, knowing how important engagement is, you cannot rely on these chance personality matches to create strong relationships. You can’t afford to. Instead, you’ve got to intentionally build communication channels and practices that create the relationships you need. I won’t lie, this requires you to level up your relationship building skills and practices. You can’t expect your developers to initiate these practices, even if they want a good relationship with you. You sit in the greater position of power, so you must take the lead and set the tone and quality of the relationship. You need individual relationships to build engagement, so you’ve got to create individual communication channels and practices between you and each of your developers. Overall my years working with managers and leaders, the most beneficial communication channel I’ve found is regular, private one-on-one meetings. The one-on-one meeting is the foundation for the relationship, allowing both of you to build trust, collaborate on problems and give honest feedback. Note the word private. “One-on-one” meetings are meant to be, well, one on one. You might be surprised how many managers try to cut corners by having them with two or three developers at a time. This is a huge mistake. The addition of even one person changes the dynamics completely. It reduces people’s ability to be honest about what they think. It sensitizes people to criticism. It can create a sense of competitiveness. And above all, it sends the message “You aren’t important enough for me to meet with individually.” This is not a message that builds good relationships. Of course, no two people are alike, so what you talk about and how will vary. Get to know each developer as a person. I typically ask about family life, hobbies, vacations and personal goals. Of course, to earn the right to ask these questions, you’ve got to be willing to answer them as well. Remember, relationships are bidirectional, so you’ve got to “give before you can take.” It goes without saying that you actually have to care about your people, or this all comes across as scripted and fake. Don’t just go through the motions, or you’ll alienate them like the Pointy-Haired Boss of Dilbert fame. No one likes to be asked about their family by their boss “because they’re supposed to ask”. That’s just insulting and sours the relationship quickly. This personal relationship lays the groundwork for work-oriented discussions about career development and goals. Candid discussions about career goals and expectations show the developer you care about them personally and professionally. This “caring” is the cornerstone of the relationship. Not everyone wants a strong relationship with their manager. Some have been hurt in the past and some don’t have the skills or don’t care. That’s their decision, but I try to find developers who want strong relationships with their manager, and I weed out the ones who don’t during interviews. That doesn’t make these people bad developers, but because good relationships are the primary indicator of developer engagement, I don’t force-fit anyone into the team simply because they have the right skills. Early in my career, I made this mistake, assuming I could build good relationships; I learned the hard way that relationships take effort and investment from both people. I’ve stopped trying to change people; instead, I look for people who value strong work relationships and display the skills necessary to build them. While good personal relationships can raise employee morale and make a workplace more enjoyable in general, there’s also a competitive business advantage to having great relationships with your employees. Consider that Gallup poll again: 50% of respondents have left a job to escape a boss. Clearly, turnover is related to relationships. Bad relationships repel people, sending them in search of a workplace with managers who care about them as people. Don’t take this lightly: if your best developers are regularly leaving, it’s costing you money. Your recruiting costs go up: Whether it’s your time spent reviewing resumes and interviewing or the cost of a headhunter, taken on an annual basis, it’s a significant cost. Your training costs skyrocket: Your new hires never hit the ground running, even if they know the tech stack you’re using. Learning your tools, process, coding standards, deployment practices and how your team communicates takes months to master, not days. Of course, any investment in an employee feels risky if you’ve got high turnover, so you might start to scrimp on the upfront training, just in case folks don’t work out. Now you’re on a bad road that only goes downhill, leaving you with a less skilled workforce that can’t deliver. Pretty soon, they’ll leave, and the cycle just keeps spiraling downward. What if you do manage to hire a rockstar ninja amazing programmer into a poorly performing team? They’ll probably take a look around them and head for the door. Great programmers with good communication skills value working with people as good as themselves. If they find they’re the most skilled, motivated person in the room, they quickly lose interest. So the good ones leave, and the poor ones stay (but don’t improve.) Lose-lose for everyone. Great relationships with your developers are key to building great software, great software teams, and getting the results you need. You need highly engaged developers, not just “code monkeys”. Without strong engagement, the smallest issues become blockers and velocity grinds to a halt. Software quality suffers as it reflects the employees’ attitudes and view of you and the company. You can’t simply hope these great relationships will happen on their own; you’ve got to build processes and channels that create them. Consider talking with your manager or HR department about what practices might already exist in your culture to create strong employee relationships. Most companies claim to value employee relationships, but too often line managers de-prioritize them day-to-day. Create habits and practices that build your relationships consistently and you’ll see improvements before you know it. These relationships will lead to competitive advantages: higher productivity, improved quality, enhanced job performance and better job satisfaction have all been tied to strong manager relationships. Remember, your investment in relationships is like water on the seeds you sow. Without a strong relationship, your investment in technical skills, domain knowledge, and the process won’t yield the results you need. With great relationships, your developers’ skills and the company goals align to produce amazing results.

According to Kondo, we can tidy up our homes, and our lives, by deciding whether each of our possessions sparks joy — and getting rid of anything that doesn’t. In a world that seems determined to make us consumers, there’s a contrasting wave of minimalism — people desperately want to cut the non-essential. Freed of excess clutter, people find joy, inspiration and, of course, their stuff. The same is true of the workplace, and I don’t mean just cleaning your desk (though that’s one of my six daily habits). I mean taking a hard look at your bigger goals, choosing your top priorities, and ruthlessly eliminating everything else. Just as paring down your domestic life can make you happier, narrowing your focus at work will lead to both increased satisfaction and productivity.

The celestial bodies are usually local to our solar system and have subtle differences. Here’s a quick refresher before we move forward with today’s story. Asteroids are rocky objects — smaller than the planets but larger than pebble-sized objects, which orbit the Sun. The asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars & Jupiter is the biggest habitat of such objects in our Solar System. Sometimes these asteroids can crash into each other. The broken off smaller pieces are called meteoroids. These meteoroids burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere & become meteors if they come close enough. The visible streaks of lights are often referred to as “shooting stars” blazing across the night sky. Some of them meteors survive the trip and land on Earth’s surface are referred to as meteorites. Comets are bodies of ice and dust which orbit the Sun like the asteroids. As they move closer to the Sun, the vaporized ice & dust form its long tail. While meteors are only visible when they start to burn up after entering our atmosphere, Comets are visible even when they are far away.

The telephone dramatically changed the way that businesses and consumers could interact. It enabled businesses to focus on their lesser angels, and reimagine their processes with a dictatorial centralized “truth” of transactions. The consequences of ubiquitous communication resulting from the telegraph and then the telephone included the minting of new oligarchs, profiteering from mass centralization, and a surge of hierarchal, top-down thinking driven by more extensible communications. As a culture, we embraced and were defined by the capabilities of the telephone, as well as its consequences, and entered into an era of corporate streamlining and mega-corporations that has prevailed into the digital era. Like the telegraph and telephone, Blockchain also known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) have a vast potential to disrupt and change the way businesses and consumers approach the delivery and consumption of products and services. In contrast to the telephone, DLT will enable the mass decentralization of processes and distribution of systems. This has the potential to generate the turnaround of decades of system design and technical architectural traditions. However, the impact will be more than just technical. Many organizations will have the ability, and some will be compelled by the competition of their markets, to re-think their entire business model. This will be true for technology-heavy industrial and supply chain businesses as well as pure service companies such as financial institutions and social networks. Organizations that deliver a completely digital service will be impacted the most, as their cost and risk structures are currently tied to centralized delivery paradigms, and their revenues are bound to holding and managing the transactional “truth” of their interactions with consumers and businesses. In these environments, distribution of truth and autonomy will become an expectation and product feature of B2B and B2C solutions. lead to happier and more satisfied customers, and but the cost will be the old processes and value propositions, and control of transactions and the truth shift to the user. A shift to DLT and distributed architecture will provide businesses with opportunities to: “It is has been my hands-on experience that the potential impact of distributed ledgers is so vast that many organizations will have the opportunity to entirely reimagine their business models as they are freed from expensive command-and-control paradigms of the past century of technological traditions.” Conversely, ignoring the impact of blockchain will be similar to companies being reluctant to embrace telephones in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Procrastinating late adopters will likely suffer from new strategic threats leveled by competitors that have embraced the impact of distributed ledger technology. The advantage of the cost improvements alone will lead to their competition being able to offer lower fees and new features with organizations that are less distracted by the complexity of the technology and processes they use to serve customers. This negative impact will be similar to the late adopters of the Internet, except that in today’s world, the time to react will be significantly shorter. “The Age of Autonomy” is my medium publication focused on the impact of the new opportunities created by autonomous and distributed systems.

If I asked you to think of 3 possible scenarios for the future of AI, I am guessing you’d think of the bad first: Takeover scenario — Terminator-style. Computers and robots dominate human species, take over our planet, and eventually wipe us off the face of Earth. Or, that the power of AI will be held, and used by a handful of tyrants whose sole purpose is to enslave the rest of us. You might’ve also thought of a hybrid scenario, where we lose some of our humanity to gain far superior computational and physical power. And finally, you might’ve even thought of brighter days where robots work for human species who now enjoy their Universal Basic Income (UBI), follow their “passions” or their “useless” creative endeavors, and live without a single worry in the world. Even though these are the most commonly talked about scenarios, I think we are missing the most probable scenarios somewhere in the “boring AI outcomes” section. First of all, AI, being as hyped of a topic as it is, attracts attention, and attention is usually not maintained by analyzing history and political philosophy and coming up with a possible outcome based on that. Attention is maintained by either fear or hope for a better tomorrow (i.e. pleasure). That’s why these ‘common scenarios’ are not only the most written but also the most read about scenarios. If you haven’t picked it up already, you’ll be reading about one of the “boring AI outcomes”. The dichotomous doomsday vs. utopia discourse around AI makes us believe that the outcome is either/or. But, most probably, just like every technology up until now, AI is (or will be) a gift and a curse. Humans, as a collective, often deem technological advances of their era far more relevant to history than they actually are. When Robert Oppenheimer witnessed the first atomic bomb test he said: “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”. And after the two bombs were dropped, everyone seemed to think that the Atomic Bomb would be the end of us. However, fortunately, thanks to the Atomic Bomb, the world has become more peaceful than ever. In fact, the threat of total annihilation, prevented one of the most potentially destructive wars the world would have ever seen (I’m talking about the Cold War). Almost every breakthrough technology has this hype around it — the radio was supposed to put us in contact with aliens. Let’s not forget the Utopian ideas surrounding the Internet in the ’90s, it was the tool, that will bring power to the people and a truly egalitarian society. Unfortunately, big corporations quickly monopolized the technology for their own growth (e.g. Facebook). Now that we have the Internet, the hype around new technologies is magnified and it reaches a wider audience. So, AI might seem even more of a historically influential invention than its predecessors. Don’t get me wrong, all of these technologies (e.g. the internet, the plane, the radio, atomic bombs, etc.) had an immense impact on history and the way humans live and interact with each other. But none of them has, and none of them will (in the near future) drastically change the overarching history of humanity, or bring an end to it. What I mean by this, is that none of these technologies, including AI, will alter the essential structure of human society. I expect you to be skeptical of all of this above (as you should). Hopefully, understanding this “essential structure of human society” I am referring to, and understanding our society today, might help clear some of the fog away. Nature either is, or we perceive it to be hierarchical. From the most simple, to the most complex ecosystems, there are those who are generally on top (predators) and those who are at the bottom (prey). Now, of course, it’s a bit more complicated, but that’s for biology class. Anyhow, within these ecosystems, almost every sub-organization has some sort of hierarchy. Alpha females, alpha males, queen bees… Well, just like in nature, human history is hierarchical too. Humans, seem to experience, and be a part of numerous hierarchies in their everyday life: from a children's playground to a traditional family setting where the father is the “head of the family”. Often, youthfulness makes us rebel, and perceive hierarchies as something bad, or something to be overthrown. But I see no way to overthrow one hierarchy, without consequently installing a new one. So, for better or for worse, hierarchies seem to be inevitable, and their nature is neither good nor bad. They are as good as the individuals that they are comprised of (especially as good as those at the top). If the father in a traditional family setting is an alcoholic and an abusive individual, the traditional family hierarchy seems bad. However, if the father is benevolent, generous, and caring the family hierarchy becomes good. Despite all the hierarchies that we are ruled by, and we are rulers of, there’s one hierarchy that seems to be constant ever since humans started grouping together in tribes. This hierarchy is beautifully explained in “The theory and practice of Oligarchical Collectivism”(which is a book, inside of a book — “1984” by George Orwell)[1]. Chapter I of “The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism” put it together quite simply: “… there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High, the Middle and the Low.” Of course, the names of the groups varied through history, but one thing stayed forever, the inescapable truth daunting us all: we are part of a self-sustaining, never-ending hierarchy, that we can only play our small part in. Speaking of which, each group in the hierarchy has an “intrinsic” aim in the hierarchy. The aims of the three groups are always at odds with each other and they seem instinctive to each group. The aim of the High (as in every other hierarchy), is to stay on top. The Middle always aims to overthrow the High, and establish their own, “better”, hierarchy. The Low, Orwell states, often don’t have a goal or aim. Usually, they are too distracted and crushed by dull, manual work, to be conscious of anything outside their daily lives. However, when they do have a goal it’s to create a society in which all are equal (all are brought down to their level.). Instinctively, the High and the Middle would do anything in their power for the Low not to get to this point of realization. Orwell, argues history, is the constant, never-ending struggle that cyclically occurs over and over again. The High, hold power securely for a long period of time, then they either lose capacity or motivation to govern and are overthrown by the Middle. Often, in order for the Middle to overthrow the High, they need the Low. The Middle gets the Low on their side by masking their fight as a fight for liberty, justice, equality and other values that the Low hold dear. Once they reach the top, the old Middle now becomes High, and instinctively push the Low back into a position of unconsciousness and drudgery. After a while, a new Middle group is created and the struggle starts again. If we take “equality” as the goal of the Low, then, it’s safe to say that the Low, have never been even remotely successful in reaching it. Before you go on reading, I want you to try and think about a period of history where this hierarchy or this struggle wasn’t present. Also, think about when having the Low been closest to reaching their goals? As I said before, the different components of the hierarchy and how they interact with each other over history have been quite changeable, but the nature and the essence of the hierarchy always stayed the same. One could make the argument that as time went on, the hierarchy “improved”. Meaning that on average the hierarchy becomes more stable with each “switch” of power between the High and the Medium. Usually, throughout most of history, the High was represented by a small group of people, seen as the elite. Each “elite group” had different ways of securing their position in the hierarchy (e.g. religion, the mandate of heaven, brute force, bloodline). But once a “revolutionary period” commences, these elite groups are easy to overthrow, since they are centralized and small in numbers. Kings, Oligarchs, Dictators and the likes, are easily replaceable. The Church was the first one to figure that you can secure your position at the top by self-inflicted social control from the bottom. They did so by manipulating ideas, offering answers to questions the average human has no answers for, and promising salvation in the afterlife for the price of believing in the holiness of the Church. The Church was successful because for a long time they convinced the Middle and the Low that simply believing in the “Highness” of the Church, grants them well being in the afterlife. Ever since the Church exposed this strategy, the goal of each sophisticated top of a hierarchical structure is a bottom-up form of social control. Before the Church, social control and social order were usually performed top-down, through the fear of violence and suffering (not to say that the Church didn’t use those methods). The revolutionary strategy of the Church used the promise of pleasure and forgiveness as a tool for social control. That way, the main executors of control would be the controlled ones themselves, individually. After many millennia, the High, figured out a way to get the Low on their side, stating that “all men are equal in Gods (read: the Church’s) eye, and if you control yourself and be our subordinate, you will receive infinite pleasure in the afterlife (Heaven). However, since these promises were hard to believe in, Capitalism took the spotlight in the 19th and 20th centuries. Capitalism, came into the picture promising the Low class, that if they work hard enough, and if they make good enough decisions they can rise up all the way to the top. This, a more believable, and attainable form of pleasure, was widely accepted by the Low classes. The horrifying brilliance of the Capitalist system (which has now evolved into ‘Corporatism’) is that for the Hierarchy to work, there’s no need for the ‘High’ class to exist in the form of human individuals. Those, that we perceive as the ‘High’ (the likes of Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, etc.) are merely the Medium class since they are not the ultimate oppressors, in fact, they are oppressed themselves. However, one could argue the current goal of the Medium class has completely changed from aiming to replace the High, to trying to preserve it. Again, both the Low, and the Medium class are oppressed by the ‘High’, but now, the High isn’t a group of powerful individuals, but the idea of our future “successful” selves. Since there are no human individuals at the top, the hierarchy now becomes more self-sustainable. Now, there’s no one at the top to take down and replace. There’s no Cesar to be stabbed in the back by Brutus. Now, instead of destroying a powerful network made up of humans to replace the hierarchy, we are tasked with destroying a system of ideas that taps deeply into the human desire for pleasure and success. Since the oppressor (the High), is an internal part of the oppressed (the Low and the Medium), the battle against oppression is lead within every individual. And currently, we are losing that battle. Attention and hunger for pleasure, are the ultimate weapons the High use to continually exercise their oppression. Throughout history, human progress and strive for technology and innovation can be traced back to one motive: social control. Social control is the art of controlling resources and conflict in a society. If one has control over resources and conflict, then they have control over people too. When the “High” lose control over resources in the hierarchy they control, there are two ways in which the “dice can fall”: either abundance or lack of resources. Additionally, when there’s an abundance of resources in a society there are two ways in which the hierarchical “game” can play out: 1. Humans get lazy and indulge in momentary pleasures, making both the individual and society weak. Consequently, the “High” will no longer be competent to hold the top, and eventually the hierarchy will descend into revolution. 2. Enough individuals in society use their abundance of resources (time and information) to educate themselves and gain necessary intellectual capacity to realize their own oppression and oppose it. Leading, again, to a revolution. Lack of resources leads to a revolution and to the fall of the “High” too. A society that lacks in resources will produce a weak High class, and an outraged Low and Medium class. This makes it easier for the Medium class to realize and demonstrate the incompetence of the High to the Low, and execute their agenda to get to the top. In this case, today’s hierarchy will descend into revolution as soon enough members of society realize that the Capitalist promise is unattainable (due to lack of resources, or by realizing that through intellect) So, in order to avoid revolution and stay at the top of a hierarchy, the High has to control resources at all times. Well, how do you do that? You control resources by increasing production and keeping a dynamic economy (industry) but avoiding the increase of real wealth[2] in the world. “Real wealth” is ‘abstract’ resources like time, attention, and freedom. Time is probably the most valuable resource, that the Low don’t utilize, even though they have it. That is due to the High’s control over attention and freedom. We already have countless of algorithms working to keep our eyes on mind-numbing, unimportant information. As already seen in numerous studies, what attracts and keeps attention the most, is conflict. So in order to keep resources low, and to control the eyes and the mind of the Low, the High has to create and control conflict. If we take the internet as an example, it has done great things for us. In fact, it’s the most egalitarian technology we’ve ever come across. Using the Internet, the masses can educate themselves by having access to unlimited information and communicate what they’ve learned at a very low cost. However, what do we see the internet being used for the most? Creating conflict. Conflict doesn’t necessarily mean war (even though it might), conflict can be a purely political divide (Trump is a perfect example), or our struggle with nature (Climate Change). The majority of the internet is used to spread frustrating information about political opposition, environmental issues and so on, or distribute unimportant attention-grabbing information and media. All in all, it is used to keep the attention of the Low far away from realizing the nature of the hierarchy and rallying against the High. To sum it all up, in order to sustain themselves, hierarchies need social control. And social control is guaranteed when material resources are low enough to limit “real wealth” in the world (like time and freedom) and high enough to meet the basic needs of the masses and allow for some hierarchical mobility. In order to control both materials, and “real wealth” resources in the world, the hierarchy uses conflict. Conflict allows resources to be wasted without the perception of them actually being wasted. For example: for many Americans, attention and resources spent in overseas wars is not a waste. Additionally, for the same reason, it is in the hierarchy’s interest to keep political, migrant and environmental crisis as a constant threat, where the crisis is never resolved, but never leads to a disaster either. To the High, this crisis is merely a way to burn resources and control attention. Now, back to 3000 words ago, let’s get to the first task we had in this essay, to come up with possible scenarios of where AI could take us. Assuming that the dynamic of the world explained above, is true, and given the current state of the world, predicting AI is much more about noticing a pattern and following a trend, than telling daunting or hopeful stories. Besides the historical pattern of hierarchies in the world described, two other trends (or patterns) are important to point out: the distribution of technology to the Low class, and the economy of attention on the Internet. One thing the late 20th and the 21st century deserve their praise for is the advances in the field of technology and science. This immense progress allowed for technologies to quickly trickle down to the lower classes. However, technology is really distributed to the “masses” as a result, rather than knowledge. The Low class, gets the product in its final form, ready to point and shoot, no questions asked. How much more does the average human of today know about digital cameras compared to a prehistoric homo sapiens? If we had a time-travel machine, went back in time and gave a digital camera to a cave-man, with some simple user guiding he would know as much about cameras as most people do. You click the big button on the top, and the thing makes a painting of whatever you point it at. That’s it. Most of us don’t know the inner workings of cameras, we just point and shoot. And this doesn’t happen because the High, hide this information from us, the information is just a Google search away. But since the High control valuable resources like time and attention, learning about new technologies and how they work isn’t available to the Low. As long as our attention is fixed on “conflicts” and our time is occupied by 8–9 hours of dreadful, monotone work, our will, and hence the ability to learn and educate ourselves will be non-existent. Oh, and don’t let me start on the educational system. Consequently, the Low will continue receiving technology as a result, rather than knowledge. The case with AI is the same, only a few select people understand how AI (Machine Learning) works at this point. In fact, I am curious how many people know what Machine Learning is as a concept, let alone understand it in its totality (which probably no one does). However, AI is already being distributed to the masses as a result. Think of Alexa, Siri, etc. This indicates, that people won’t really have much say into AI in the future (especially the ethics of it). Future forms of AI will be distributed to the Low as nicely packaged black boxes of results (products). One terrifying trend that I see is the ability for surveillance in these “products”, and our slow desensitization to it. If the true currency of the real world is time, then the currency of the Internet is attention. And both tech Goliaths and Davids are fighting over who gets to dictate attention. Their weapon of choice: algorithms. It is safe to say that “v1.0” of AI is currently being used to control attention on the Internet. Even though I split the prediction in two, read the two parts as one cohesive whole. The two predictions interact and create the full picture. 1. The future of conflict Here’s a bold statement: AI will lead to more conflict. Even though we are far from general AI, we are very close to AI automating and “freeing” us from a lot of our jobs (especially the jobs usually occupied by the Low). With autonomous vehicles, virtual personal assistants, and Google’s AI powered contact center, on the horizon, we are looking to automate jobs raging from taxi and truck drivers to receptionists, to call center staff. Eventually, we will automate all monotone jobs that require a limited amount of creativity. This will include the jobs that provide us with most of our basic resources — farming, maintenance of solar energy systems, water centers, etc. From this, there are two possible outcomes: - There’s no need for work anymore, Universal Basic Income (UBI) is in place, so people have immense amounts of free time. or - People engage in creative jobs and careers, that isn’t stressful and incentivize thinking and individuality. In other words, the real wealth of the world will increase. Thus, the need for more conflict will arise. Conflict will be mainly created to waste three resources: time, attention, and human labor (all of these play into each other. For example, one could argue that human labor = time, and time = attention well spent). So essentially it’s one resource, that I’ll call freedom. Freedom in the 21st century is being able to control your own time, labor and attention. To “waste” the freedom of the Low, the High need conflict. When we think of the war in the future (especially having AI in mind), we think humans vs. robots (Terminator), or robots vs. robots epically shooting each other to dysfunction (Transformers). Whatever the case may be, we forget that war is a good way to shift people's attention from important matters, to waste labor (and life for that matter), and consequently waste time. In times when resources were scarce, wars were waged to accumulate more, and increase the chances of survival. Now, there’s an abundance of resources, and accumulating more, doesn’t work well for the hierarchy. Well, like it or not, wars can lead to an increase in resources. What do the High answer to that? We’ll wage “value” wars. “Value” wars are wars that are waged based on ideology (or values). The religion and the communism card don’t really work anymore, so now, terror(ism) is used as the reason to wage war. Since “value” wars don’t bring any sort of materialistic improvement to the world, they are the perfect “resource wasters”. War, as a conflict, becomes morally ambiguous and gory. The hierarchy needs conflict in which the Low wants to participate. So conflict takes on the form of an environmental or political crisis. It is virtuous to engage in peaceful conflict for a just political cause. It’s even more virtuous to to save the planet. This will be the future of conflict in the world. Artificial Intelligence will further polarize political discussions. We can already see this happening. The internet is supposed to expose all of these diverse ideas to us. But, it does the complete opposite. Due to social network algorithms, we are either exposed to content that keeps us happy or angry. A conservative is shown the absolute best of the conservative landscape, and the absolute worst of the liberal landscape, and vice versa. There are much less white supremacist and radical social justice warriors in the world if you take the internet out of the equation. Social network algorithms keep individuals in an environment where their world view is reinforced and all others are discredited. When you gain confidence in your beliefs, you lose empathy for the beliefs of others. And discussions tend to be unsuccessful when empathy is absent. When discussions are unsuccessful, the political atmosphere gets heated up and polarized, leading to more conflict. The Hierarchy will use AI to enhance attention-controlling algorithms in order to control conflict. AI algorithms might tap into our deepest evolutionary biases to direct our attention to political conflict and turmoil whenever needed. P.S. This is already happening. One of the most concerning matters of the 21st century is Climate Change. We are both frightened of Nature flipping the off switch on us, and hopeful that through technology and innovation we will weather the storm. Technology and AI won’t solve the climate crisis. They won’t accelerate it into Armageddon, either. The Hierarchy will maintain the crisis for as long as it can. We are running out of wars to wage, and political conflict can become a burden to our social life. So, the Hierarchy needs a conflict that’s both morally justifiable, and socially unburdensome. Even though the climate crisis is a result of a communal action, our reaction to it is individual. Instead of big corporations being blamed and punished for unethical production, individual consumers are blamed for buying “dirty”, cheap products. On an individual level a move towards “clean living” is evident, however, we can’t see this reflected in public policies and corporate practices (with some obvious exceptions). While individuals (mostly, the Low), spend their time, attention and resources trying to “save the planet”, the High stay on top of the hierarchy, by wasting these resources. Either way, technological progress (such as AI) coupled with human creativity and will, are eventually going to solve a lot of our environmental problems. However, the High will continue to find ways to keep the environment on the brink of disaster. Or they will find a way to maintain this narrative for as long as possible. AI and technological progress will surely help us solve a lot of our problems, but how far will we go to create new ones? While we are questioning the ethics of a certain technology, we fail to examine the failure of our own, collective, human morality. 2. The future of surveillance The Low is resisting surveillance due to their evolutionary need for social acceptance and privacy. However, the High, don’t use surveillance to invade the privacy of individuals. Privacy invasion is just collateral damage from the High’s pursuit of social control. The High isn’t interested in your personal life, they are interested in controlling your time and attention. Our personal lives, habits, interests, and relationships are just a mean that is used to reach the goal of social control. Once the High have relevant information regarding an individual’s habits, personal views, interest and so on, they can now exercise their control. The internet has made the process of gathering relevant information and successfully storing it scalable and easier to monopolize. Since hierarchies exercise social control either through pain or pleasure, their goal is to know your biggest fears and desires. Once the High knows all of their subject’s individual fears and desires, they have cracked the code to attention and intelligence control. Hierarchies, before the modern era usually relied on control through fear. Simply because meeting individual desires is more difficult. Now, with the rise of new technologies, the modern “western” hierarchy can combine both. In fact, the High is currently betting on both. Either way, just like the Internet, AI will make it even easier for the High to both gather information (e.g. Siri, Alexa, E-cars), and distribute attention-controlling content based on the information gathered (Social Networks, Search Engines, etc.). AI will keep the Low at the bottom and the High on top. So why bother? The text above might give you the idea that we are conditioned to infinite control and oppression. Even, that hierarchies are inherently bad, and sadly, inescapable. So why bother discussing the ethics of rising technologies such as AI, revolt against unjust decisions and speak up, if, at the end of the day the High will stay on top and the Low at the bottom? Well, as I mentioned above, hierarchies are as good or bad as the individuals that are a part of them. As individuals, it is our duty to constantly improve the hierarchies we are part of, no matter what “class” we are part of or what position we are in. And how do we improve our hierarchies? Hierarchies and the relations within them are extremely complex. There’s no easy 3 step guideline to fixing hierarchies. It involves dedication, self-reflection, empathy and of course, a lot of reason. My coming article will deal with this topic. So we’ll try and figure it out in a week or so. Maybe a month, depending on how lazy I get, and how many people actually want it. — — — — — — Notes on the text: I am aware that the text is way too long. I’ll soon do a TLDR version of this. It’s only going to be in bullet points. Books that inspired me to write this: 1984 (Especially Chapter 9) by George Orwell; Brave New World by Aldous Huxley; Pedagogy of the Oppressed by Paulo Freire; Sapiens, A brief history of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari; Footnotes: [1] Because of this small part in Chapter 9, 1984 will have a never-ending relevance. The brilliance of it is that it’s not only a indispensable tool for understanding modern history, but it’s a way of getting an idea of what the future might be like. [2] My definition of “real wealth” is an extension of what Emmanuel Goldstein writes about in “The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism” in 1984.

https://medium.com/syncedreview/ai-development-and-trends-in-e-commerce-55b59c68b7?source=tag_archive---------8-----------------------,AI Development and Trends in E-Commerce,Published in SyncedReview,Synced,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Synced Follow SyncedReview -- Listen Share The traditional retail industry is undergoing a significant reinvention and upgrade as more and more brick and mortar stores boost business by adopting e-commerce platforms powered by cutting-edge tech. The recent rapid development and deployment of AI technologies such as machine learning, computer vision and reinforcement learning have enabled new e-commerce products and solutions for various scenarios and strengthened the retail value chain. E-commerce business typically activates across multiple online sales platforms (e.g. Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall, Amazon, JD.com); or on a brand’s own official web stores (e.g. Tesla, Nike, Casper). Thanks to recent advancements in AI and digital technologies, operating costs for e-commerce have been reduced, enabling more retailers to realize e-commerce transformations. The 2018 global retail e-commerce market amounted to US$2.8 trillion and is expected to grow 75 percent to US$4.9 trillion by 2021. China is the world’s largest e-commerce market with the most B2C sales and biggest consumer base. According to an AliRearch (阿里研究院) survey of more than 1,000 e-commerce retailers in China, over 80 percent of the merchants have adopted and frequently use AI tools in their businesses. Current AI-driven e-commerce strategies are mainly supported by computer vision, natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning technologies.  Computer Vision: By leveraging computer vision, retailers are able to create product listings with high-quality images, enabling customers to better understand the details of a product or service. Computer vision technology also has prospects in areas such as algorithm-driven product poster design and product recommendations based on customers’ visual style preferences.   NLP: E-commerce platforms use NLP in their searching and sorting algorithms for keyword analysis and attribute extraction from product descriptions to improve the shopping experience with better product matching. Dynamic NLP-driven sorting systems can also more efficiently guide customers to trending products.   Reinforcement Learning: Many large e-commerce platforms utilize reinforcement learning technology and big data in user behavior prediction, to optimize product rankings on search results and boost their e-commerce conversion rates. Product Searching: Product searching is one of the most frequently used and important features for e-commerce platforms. Customers are able to find products matching their interests through keywords, where product matching relies on NLP technologies; and visual “search by image,” which leverages computer vision. E-commerce platforms also utilize reinforcement learning technologies to optimize their ranking algorithms and deliver better search results.  Personalized Product Recommendation: In addition to searching, e-commerce platforms also use machine learning and NLP techniques to engage consumers and make personalized product recommendations based on their shopping trends and browsing history.  Dynamic Pricing: Many e-commerce platforms use dynamic pricing tools powered by big data and machine learning algorithms to make real-time price adjustments or predict future prices based on supply and demand projections.  Fraud Risk Management: E-commerce retailers utilize machine learning technologies to identify potential fraudulent credit card transactions to prevent and control risks in real time and ensure secure online payments. Alibaba: Alibaba launched its self-developed image search engine “Pailitao” in 2014. Since then, Pailitao has been widely implemented on Alibaba e-commerce platforms “Taobao” and “AliExpres” to automatically return visually similar pictures to those uploaded by consumers, helping for example to coordinate clothing, accessories and other products.  Pinterest: In 2017 US social media platform Pinterest launched its visual search tool “Lens” as an idea discovery engine on its mobile app. The company partnered with retail giant Target to integrate Pinterest’s Lens into the target.com e-commerce platform to help customers find items of interest through images.  Stitch Fix: As a personal styling service provider, Stitch Fix delivers highly personalized clothing recommendations with styling algorithms developed using machine learning technology and individual customer preferences and purchase history data.  Amazon: Amazon has long implemented dynamic pricing algorithms for product sales on its e-commerce platform, frequently adjusting product prices based on factors such as inventory and demand trends. Cold Start Problem: Due to data scarcity, retailers operating a new business on an e-commerce platform may not be able to take advantage of advanced AI-based features like recommendation system and dynamic pricing that rely on big data and analytics.   Algorithm Scalability Issue: Reinforcement learning technology can encounter performance bottlenecks on e-commerce platforms. Algorithms often struggle with scaling problems and can face challenges effectively and efficiently searching through very large decision spaces.  Long Tail Effect: E-commerce recommendation algorithms may present only a small number of the most popular items to customers, and fail to recommend rare “long-tail” products that could be more appealing to niche consumers, as such products can for example lack sufficient ratings data. Data-driven Customization: Personalized product searching and recommendation algorithms based on individual user information (e.g., social behavior, occupation, preferences, etc.) will become increasingly common on e-commerce platforms.  Human in the Loop: Business operating models that combine AI with human expertise will become increasingly prevalent. For example, the company Stitch Fix has adopted a hybrid approach that always keeps humans in the loop to support for example product recommendations.  Connecting Offline Channels with Online E-commerce Retailing: More retailers, especially fashion merchants, have provided “search by image” services to enable consumers to locate and make online purchases of an item they see for example at a fashion show or in a print magazine.

Artificial intelligence is seen as the future technological advancement in the current world scenario, in today’s world we have some AI technologies but we have not fully achieved artificial intelligence yet. So how AI will change our future and how we mix this technology with our lives, these are some of the questions we all want to know.In the below article you can learn about the types of AI TYPES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Reactive Machines AI in initial days ways made for the reactive purpose, this type of artificial intelligence was not able to utilize its past experiences to perform the present task. Deep Blue is a chess-playing computer of IBM that defeated the international grandmaster of chess Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Reactive machine AI observes the things and reacts to that based on pre-programmed functions. Limited Memory From the name itself defines that it has artificial intelligence with limited memory. In this type of AI, the system can utilize its past experiences and gain information from it, but this could be done for a short duration. This type of artificial intelligence is mainly used in autonomous cars to protect from accidents. It takes around 100 seconds for an AI to make a decision in such self drove cars. Self-Awareness Basically this type of Artificial Intelligence has not been developed yet, we as a human does not experience self-awareness AI yet. This type of AI development can identify themselves, the machine or robots are well aware of themselves and there own functioning. So they can possess self-developed emotions from there experiences. Theory of mind This kind of AI mainly focuses on human feelings and psychology, this benefits in understanding human reasoning and beliefs. You can say that the Theory of Mind is a higher variant of Artificial Intelligence which appreciates human conduct and feelings. This sort of AI still not exists fully in the present universes.

Now, two centuries later, the nation is carving a new digital identity in the fourth industrial revolution. I had the pleasure of being in Belfast this week with colleagues from Digital Leaders NI for the launch of a new report commissioned by Civica and independently produced. The research brought together senior leaders and industry experts from across Northern Ireland to discuss how the nation can thrive in this digital age, along with new research from more than 1,000 citizens. As part of the research phase Digital Leaders NI held a round table day talking about all aspects of a digital Northern Ireland. I was pleased to see the feedback from that room of cross-sector experts had been reflected in the report’s findings. Any of us in the Digital Transformation sector working in London will be aware of how many talented Northern Irish businesses and individuals we bump into on a daily basis and so the report wanted to understand what the state of play in NI is and what actions were needed. Whilst it is clear that the landscape in Northern Ireland is changing, both politically and demographically, and although framed for the modern age, the same question remains: How can leaders across all sectors step up and deliver a future-proofed digital model that not only meets the evolving needs of citizens, but also ensures Northern Ireland thrives and realises its digital destiny? The resulting report — The Changing Landscape for Northern Ireland: Strengthening Northern Ireland’s digital identity — identifies opportunities for leaders to accelerate the next chapter in that digital evolution. Two points in the report stand out for me. Firstly, Northern Ireland needs to find ways to retain its digital talent to keep it in the region. Northern Ireland seems to me to have a lot to offer in terms of lifestyle, but additional benefits from employers needs to be a big part of this as well as salaries that make London less attractive. To quote John Napier, Director of DfI Digital Services, Department of Infrastructure, “the region needs to have flexible and fluid employers.” Secondly, to retain and cement its place as a technology driven region, public and private sector leaders in Northern Ireland must push hard and up the pace by continuing to invest in initiatives designed to meet its rapidly growing demands in all areas of life. As Mark Owens, Managing Director, Northern Ireland, Civica says “simply sitting back and letting digital delivery slip is not an option.” For me personally, one of the lighter moments in the report was the research into consumers views on digital public services. People approved of them, found them helpful and easy to use, and wanted more of them, but rather than crediting the public sector for this, they also saw the exercise as being motivated by a desire for cost savings. The benefits they were enjoying as a result of these digital services were merely a “happy coincidence”. I suspect many citizens across the UK might offer the same research results.

https://medium.com/@alitech_2017/standing-up-to-the-surge-alibabas-x-engine-weathers-a-storm-of-transaction-data-f1f491778313?source=tag_archive---------60-----------------------,Standing Up to the Surge: Alibaba’s X-Engine Weathers a Storm of Transaction Data,Written by Alibaba Tech,Alibaba Tech,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Alibaba Tech Follow -- Listen Share This article is part of the Academic Alibaba series and is taken from the SIGMOD 2019 paper entitled “X-Engine: An Optimized Storage Engine for Large-scale E-commerce Transaction Processing” by Gui Huang, Xuntao Cheng, Jianying Wang, Yujie Wang, Dengcheng He, Tieying Zhang, Feifei Li, Sheng Wang, Wei Cao, and Qiang Li. The full paper can be read here. It is often said that e-commerce has achieved things unimaginable just a few years ago. Still, it is interesting to try to imagine what it would look like if a brick-and-mortar business were to experience what e-commerce giant Alibaba contends with at least once a year — say, for instance, the 122-fold spike in transactions in span of a single second that launched last year’s 11.11 Global Shopping Festival. Whereas for a shopping mall this kind of surge would mean a literal stampede of shoppers, though, the above deluge happened mostly out of view in the depths of Alibaba’s data centers, challenging its systems to once again outdo their yearly best at processing transactions. As the largest e-commerce platform in the world, Alibaba often needs to innovate solutions to challenges solely its own in the computing world. Now, to better contend with mass forces from its 600 million-strong shopper base, Alibaba researchers have introduced a write-optimized storage engine known as X-Engine that manages swings in data records’ “temperatures” as they move through a shifting terrain of promotions and flash sales, among other issues. Based on an LSM-tree tiered storage architecture, X-Engine works as a core component of Alibaba’s POLARDB distributed database designed to serve online transaction processing. Alibaba’s transaction database challenges are well summarized in a trio of water-themed metaphors. The first, known as the tsunami problem, concerns the inherent risk of publicizing a major promotional event. No matter how much the marketplace prepares, the full scale of consumer activity can only be known when the anticipated day arrives, often shocking expectations. The second, the flood discharge problem, concerns how Alibaba’s storage engine works to quickly convey data from the main memory to durable storage while processing highly concurrent transactions, much as drainage systems struggle to during heavy rainfall. The last, the fast-moving current problem, is somewhat more complex; at its core is the problem of “hot” and “cold” records in relatively instantaneous or latent demand, respectively, with any such record threatening to change temperature and impact systemic data-flow currents as conditions in the marketplace change. To address the tsunami problem, X-Engine improves the single-machine capacity of storage engines so that the number of instances needed to handle a spike in transactions is vastly reduced. To handle the flood discharge problem, it makes use of the tiered storage offered by the LSM-tree structure and a number of optimized compaction algorithms, moving records among different tiers that correspond to different “temperatures” of access frequency; notably this approach tries to employ a number of different forms of memory that are ideal for specific tiers, including new technologies like NVM storage. Finally, to improve conditions under the fast-moving current problem, X-Engine helps to ensure that emerging hot records that are located at deep (i.e. cooler) regions of the database can be moved out as quickly as possible for effective caching. X-Engine faced off against popular storage engines InnoDB and RocksDB in tests designed to simulate real-world e-commerce workloads using benchmark datasets. Most notably, X-Engine achieved remarkably stable QPS (queries per second) performance in the crucial test case designed to emulate the 11.11 Global Shopping Festival workload, outperforming InnoDB and Rocks DB by 44% and 31%, respectively.

And even though this software practice has many advantages, teams doing code reviews also encounter quite a few code review pitfalls. In this article, I explain the main code review pitfalls you should be aware of to ensure code reviewing does not slow your team down. Knowing which pitfalls and problems arise can help you to ensure a productive and effective code review experience. Those findings are based on a survey we conducted at Microsoft with over 900 participants. A typical tool-based code review process looks roughly like this: Once the developer has finished a piece of code, they prepare the code for being submitted for review. Then, they select reviewers who are notified about the review. The reviewers then review the code and give comments. The author of the code works on those comments and improves and changes the code accordingly. Once everybody is satisfied, or an agreement is reached, the code can be checked into the code base.

https://medium.com/weachieve/the-age-of-distraction-a646ac32a999?source=tag_archive---------80-----------------------,The Age of Distraction,The Content Expansion,Ben Mumma,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ben Mumma Follow Achievement Oriented -- Listen Share The internet has changed the fundamentals of how we’ve live. Understanding what changed can tell us where to go next. The term “age of distraction” first appeared in a major news source in the New York times on May 4, 2009. It appeared in a seemingly quaint article titled “Ear Plugs to Lasers: The Science of Concentration” by John Tierney. Looking back, 2009 feels like a lifetime ago: a quaint idyllic time where life was simpler and people were happier. Since then, several books have started to use the term — the first being a book titled “The Age of Distraction” by Professor Robert Hassan in late 2011. Fast forward to today, and it’s clear that these voices may have been right at the time, but were clearly prophetic about the days to come. With more sources than ever fighting for our attention (conveniently monetized by digital ads), we have endless printed, audio, video, and game-based content at the tip of our fingers. Yet this build-up hasn’t happened all at once: the content has piled upon itself as the platforms supporting them have become more robust. Let’s take the example of YouTube: 2009 YouTube was popular, but a fraction of the size it is today. Just to give you a sense: in 2010, 24 hours of video were uploaded to YouTube every minute of the day. By 2015, this number had climbed to 400 hours of video uploaded each minute. That’s an incredible expansion! While latest numbers aren’t available, YouTube’s library of content has surely expanded quite steadily since 2015. Looking back, we can identify when the amount of content bombarding us started to take its toll on our collective psyche. No matter how much you can filter, you are going to notice a 10x increase in information volume around you. To get a sense of what this does to us, we can use Google Trends. It is an amazing tool for understanding how the world is thinking, at least going back to 2004 anyway. Doing so paints a very clear picture of how today’s content deluge is impacting us and can pinpoint when the age of distraction truly began. For those who were around the early days of the internet, you probably remember what it was like to be “bored.” Indeed, you’d just type that into Google and see where it took you. Based on this measure, “peak boredom” on the internet was reached in late 2009, and declined sharply through 2012. Since then, it’s declined at a slow-but-steady rate of about 5% per year. Fast forward to today, and “boredom” is at 40% of what it was in 2010. Meanwhile, we see signs in many places that mental health issues are on the rise. Jon Haidt and Greg Lukianoff shared many of these alarming trends in their recent book, the Coddling of the American Mind. And Google Trend data backs up the assertion that we are feeling the effects of the internet age. While we see many trends on the rise for terms like “stressed”, “anxious”, “too busy”, and more, nothing quite captures the current day like the trend for “overwhelmed.” Look back to 2004: search volume for “overwhelmed was less than 20% of it’s volume today. After rising steadily through 2011, it rocketed up to new levels in 2012. Since then, it has remained steady, but it has become a prominent feature in our collective psyche. Paired together, these trends show how much we’ve changed over the past few years. Taken literally, boredom has declined by 60% while feeling overwhelmed has increased by 500%. With six years on the books of feeling overwhelmed, it’s small wonder the whole world today feels more chaotic and out-of-control than ever before. Fortunately, humans are quite adaptive beings. For one, entrepreneurs are starting to build the platforms that help us navigate a content-saturated world. While today’s money is made by generating distractions, someone is going to figure out how to extract value from helping you focus instead. Meditation apps like those being made by Sam Harris, Kevin Rose, and Dan Harris are just one example of this. More will come. Apple’s recent capitulation to release screen-time data to its users is another win for anyone looking to reclaim their time toward the pursuits that matter to them.

Here are a few ways to optimize your device. By Evan Dashevsky and Jason Cohen PCs, tablets, smartphones — even our coffee makers — can wirelessly connect to the internet at the push of a button, and devices buzz with emails, notifications, and status updates at all hours of the day. But it’s hard to imagine life without your Samsung Galaxy Note 9 or Google Pixel 3. Fortunately, there are ways to avoid some of these small irritations and make your day just a little bit calmer. Here are some facts that should be completely unrelated: 1) AT&T is my wireless carrier. 2) AT&T owns DirecTV. 3) I am not a DirectTV subscriber. However, a DirecTV remote app came pre-installed on my phone. And I can’t delete it. Welcome to the world of bloatware. Bloatware is a blanket term used to describe pre-installed apps that take up space and resources on your phone. These apps — many of which you’ll never use — come courtesy of your phone’s manufacturer, carrier, and Google itself (plus a few licensed third-party apps thrown in for good measure). If you look through the apps on your phone, you’ll almost certainly find a bunch of apps you never downloaded and will never use. While bloatware is not unique to mobile devices, it’s most insidious on phones because of the limited computational resources, compared to those on your home PC. Though most bloatware can be deleted, there are some apps that can’t go anywhere. By getting rid of what you can, they won’t tap into your phone’s background resources anymore. Long-press on the app icon to prompt the disable option. Alternatively, you can access individual app options by going to Settings > Apps and tapping on the app. Have you ever noticed your screen suddenly dimming or brightening all by itself? That’s auto brightness at work. This feature automatically adjusts your screen’s brightness depending on its environment. Basically, your phone screen will dim to complement the luminescence of a fancy candlelit dinner, but will brighten way up if you’re outside picnicking on a sunny day. Want to see it in action? If it’s on your device, cover up the light sensor on your phone for a few seconds (it’s usually on the top of the front-facing side of your device) and your screen should compensate accordingly. In theory, the feature is great. If you primarily use your phone in similarly lit indoor environments, then you might not even realize you have it. However, it tends to overcompensate a bit too much (and too suddenly) in either direction. Auto brightness is on by default on most Android systems. If you don’t have any problems with it, then let it be. However, if you’ve found it to be a bit jarring, you can turn it off by going to Settings > Display. In some versions of Android, this screen-brightness setting will be available in the pull-down shade (but more on that later). With auto brightness turned off, you can choose a static lighting setting to your liking and manually move as necessary (but keep in mind that a brighter screen burns up more juice). Your phone is sure to notify you when someone comments on your latest Facebook post, likes your tweet, or emails you spam, but some information you don’t necessarily need waking you from your slumber at 3 a.m. on a Tuesday. Fortunately, Android provides a way out of this: Do Not Disturb. You can schedule Do Not Disturb via Settings > Sounds and vibration > Do not disturb. Here, you can tell your phone to forgo all notifications during a specific time, even phone calls. Of course, there will be notifications you’ll want at all hours of the day. Instead of flipping the switch, tap directly on Do not disturb to enter the feature’s settings menu. Here you can set up a recurring schedule for this mode, and you can even allow exceptions. In the Exceptions setting, you can always allows calls and messages from particular contacts (say, all those designated as “Favorites”), from “priority” apps, or even from callers who have repeatedly tried to reach you (the type of calls you get in an emergency situation). If some apps are sending too many notifications, shut them off for that program. Maybe you’re getting annoying messages from social media apps, or perhaps those games you downloaded to your phone are a little too needy. Go to Settings > Notifications > and you can toggle all app notifications on/off or individually. Tap on a listed app to choose whether you want an entire notification card to pop up on your phone or not. One of the best features on an Android phone is the pull-down shade (or notification shade). Simply slide your finger from the top of your screen down and you’ll find oft-used settings in nifty one-touch button form (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Location). And Android is nice enough to allow you to choose which icons are included in the shade for easy access. Perhaps you don’t really use things like Wi-Fi calling or NFC, but like having the ability to quickly set your phone to vibrate, toggle Location on/off, or access the flashlight — all with a single tap. You can rearrange which buttons appear in the shade by tapping the hamburger icon () in the top-right corner of the shade and tap the edit button. You can then move the buttons around to your liking. Your Android phone offers several ways to protect your device. Requiring a password, fingerprint, or some other form of biometric authentication adds a small barrier between you and your digital world, but it’s worth it. Still, security and convenience don’t have to be enemies — for example, you can set your phone to not require a login for a set amount of time after it goes to sleep. Find the lock time that works for your lifestyle. Go to Settings > Lock screen and security > Secure lock settings > Secured lock time > choose the time that works for you. Alternatively, your phone may have a “Smart Lock” setting (nested under “Secure lock settings”), which keeps your phone unlocked when it registers you are in a “trusted” location (i.e. it can tell when it’s at your home via location services, or if it is connected to a trusted device like your car via Bluetooth). In this instance, you’ll also just have to trust the users around you. Like to post selfies to Instagram or Snapchat? Sure, we all like to show off our fabulous new dos or that time we met that celebrity at that thing. You might have noticed that the in-app camera on these apps are kinda…lacking? If you’re not happy with the in-app camera your apps offer you, there is a very simple workaround. Take photos with your phone’s stock (and probably superior) photo app and upload to these social networks after the fact. If you’re an Android user and you’re not taking advantage of widgets, you’re doing it wrong. Widgets are live app windows you can keep open on an individual home screen page. Many of the apps you will download also come with a widget that works in tandem with the program. If there is information you check often — email, weather, music, podcasts — you can just create a widget and fill up a portion of your home screen with it. Widgets make it a lot easier to access information — no need to open an app and swipe around for the info you’re looking for, because now it’s just always right there. To create a widget, long-press anywhere on any home screen page to prompt a series of options. Here, you’ll find the widgets link — tap that and you can swipe through a list of apps that have available widgets (not all apps do). Tap on any app widget and drag it into an open sector. Some widgets will come in different sizes and shapes to allow you options when fitting it onto your home screen. This tip is applicable to all mobile phone users: Get an external Bluetooth speaker. Some phones boast impressive speakers, but smartphone speakers (even top-of-the-line ones) can only achieve so much volume and bass. If you really want to fill a room, you’re going to need an external speaker. There are many high-quality Bluetooth speakers you can connect to your phone to listen to music, streaming radio, or podcasts while you perform other tasks around the house.

https://medium.com/@peterkimnyc/joining-apollo-graphql-89ce1c8e43d2?source=tag_archive---------35-----------------------,Joining Apollo GraphQL,Written by Peter Kim,Peter Kim,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Peter Kim Follow -- Listen Share After some time off with my family, I’ll be joining Apollo GraphQL at the end of the month to be one of the early members of their sales team. If you’re not familiar with GraphQL, it’s a query language that’s quickly becoming the de facto standard for front-end applications to exchange data with back-end services in the modern application stack. While the spec for the query language is maintained by the GraphQL Foundation, Apollo’s implementation of the spec is by far the most popular. Apollo also offers services such as schema, client, and operations registries, a trace warehouse, and other features that are essential for managing and operating GraphQL at scale, in production. The technology itself gets me really excited, but just as important in choosing Apollo was getting a sense for who they are and what they value. During the interview process, I never felt like I was being evaluated against a checklist of requirements for the role. It was clear Apollo was more interested in who I am, what I care about, what gets me excited. At the end of a long day of interviews, Apollo’s head of sales asked me very pointedly “Peter, do you feel like you know Apollo?” He must have sensed I was confused. Was he asking me if I understood the technology or the value proposition of their products? He continued, “Peter, after spending the day with you, Apollo feels like we know who you are. I hope you also have come to really know who we are.” I love joining companies early on because there’s a very palpable sense of hope and promise that we’re in the midst of creating something different. Sadly, many companies seem to eventually give up on that pursuit. Maybe because things get hard and they fall back on what’s tried and true? Or maybe because it gets too hard to convince prospective hires to believe in these crazy hopes and dreams of creating a new type of company? I’m excited to be entering a place where I feel a strong sense of that hope and promise once again. Hope is so important. It’s the driving force for what motivates us to something better than the status quo.

We at XR-I have drawn clear boundary lines to the whole architecture of the augmented reality system so it could be easily understand and deployed into the industry with full confidence. There are already many successful AR implementations that require little time to develop nor knowledge. Remote expert applications, for example, are easy to set up and provide some of the greatest returns on investment. Many companies and organizations relay already into video conferencing technology like Skype and Zoom to manage their business. So there is already a need and this need could be filled easily by an AR- Technology. Once a successful AR program is in place, organizations can then begin exploring niche or company-specific applications. With the right software, it can be surprisingly easy to create and publish AR content. XR-I uses mainly game engines like Unity3D and Visual Studio to deploy our AR-Applications. It is available in the market for a very low price and also there are tons of resources and examples to set you on the right tracks. However, content value is based on the knowledge it conveys, not the speed at which it’s produced. We believe quality overcomes the quantity at all time. It is therefore vital that AR programs recruit veteran experience from their manufacturing and maintenance operations to ensure content trans-lates into effective tools once it reaches the factory floor. With software development kits (SDKs) like PTC’s Vuforia Studio and MRKT for Hololens, companies can reuse their digital assets coming from design engineering to quickly create 2D and 3D instructions and visual aids for the manufacturing and maintenance groups. The starting of the journey will be overwhelming but based on our experience it is fruitful in the long run. With the proper tools, creating these guides should be simple and straightforward. AR is not necessary for every manual process in the factory. It is important to address complex tasks since they require the most experience to execute efficiently and often contribute to quality issues. It is better to tackle a simple problem that exists in the company. One should be very firm on these questions “Does the AR really solving the problem?” and “Are there any longterm gains from this AR solution?”Generally, it is easier to develop AR applications for repetitive tasks since less variability needs to be accounted for. When launching a pilot project, companies should consider the resources that would be required to scale the solution to meet future needs regardless of the initial intent of the program. Seek AR authoring and publishing solutions designed with a focus on enterprise applications; it is generally easier to scale these down, than scale other applications up. Keep it as simple as possible. We at XR-I discovered that AR-Application can be easily scaled up fast with an Industry cloud framework like OPC Unified Architecture. XR-I : Values and visions for the AR-future We believe promoting the awareness and the knowledge of AR potential for the industry field will boost the development of Industry 4.0 in return. When we reach a high efficient workflow of Industry 4.o, many injustice and problems in humanity will be eradicated. XR-I strongly believe AR serves as the first step towards spatial computing which will enable every single human to be given the rights of knowledge at his fingertips. Through knowledge one is empowered for the rest of his life.

In his newest YouTube video, Reeves builds a handful of those ridiculous project ideas. The first project he tackles is an automatic desk-clearer. This would come in handy all those times you need an empty desk right now and don’t care about breaking everything you own. You know, like when you inadvertently find yourself in a romance movie and the action is about to start. Reeves built that one with a pneumatic actuator and a few 3D-printed parts, and it works just about as well as you’d expect. Fun! The next project was one every maker would love: a literal hot glue gun. Are you tired of your hot glue gun just lazily oozing viscous goo onto your project? This pneumatic hot glue gun built around a CO2 BB gun literally shoots globs of glue with 65psi of compressed air instead. Efficient! The final build is a robot that dumps water onto itself — for some reason. Obviously, this is a one-time-use type of robot. It has a cup of water sitting in a pivoting holder that’s actuated by a servo, which is controlled by a microcontroller development board. Push a button, and the robot pours the cup of water on itself, and self-destructs in the process.

The GW-01 is a modified version of that RPi board (GW-01 RPI), and the GW-01 PoE gateway, which packs an i.MX6 ULL processor. M2M-IOT’s GW-01 for the OrangePi Zero H2+ is designed around Semtech’s LoRaWAN-equipped SX1301 chip and uses the 868MHz or 915MHz frequencies. As for features, the board has a -139dBm sensitivity, an external antenna, 10/100M Ethernet port, an operating temperature range of 0°C to 70°C, and has a communication range of about 1.5-miles in the city, and 6.2-miles in open areas. On the software side, the GW-01 comes with OpenWrt pre-installed, however, M2M<-IOT states that Armbian can be used if needed. Users may have to change the frequencies as well, depending on the country, the company explains: “It can be easily done just by replacing single text file named global_conf.json. You can find some explanation of frequency plans here. Just get corresponding configuration file and replace existing global conf.json with a new one. For example, you need to use EU868 frequency plan with an 868MHz gateway in Europe. US915 and 915MHz gateway in the USA.” It should be noted that for prototyping endeavors, the GW-01 LoRaWAN Gateway requires at least one end node, along with a web server, which M2M-IOT recommends its cloud.m2m-tele.com server or The Things Network. The GW-01 LoRaWAN Gateway is now available on M2M-IOT’s site for $120, and documentation for the board can be found on the company’s GitHub page. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg"

I have seen the evolution curve from the days of early programming languages, SDK’s, data cubes, CGI, apache, web scripting, java, p2p etc. Some of these technologies are already relegated to history or have morphed into something unrecognizably new. But, many of the yesteryear technologies (if I am allowed to call it that way) did one thing really well. They seem to empower an individual and gave him/her the choice to do the new and earn their place. In other words, there was a sense of democratization of technology as it’s spread its wings. Armed with the new, one felt and established relevance in the material world while they may still have started to slip away from the metaphysical world. One’s heightened state of mind led them to believe in themselves where some felt liberated, some felt included, some felt gratified, some felt they too belong to a sub-culture that bred only success. Well, at least this is what it looked from the outside. Essentially, armed with your new tools, you worked hard for the masters and the masters took good care of you. Well, they made your dreams come true. Almost. As a creator of technology, you also helped the consumers of technology achieve their dreams and so on. It all seemed like a happy place to be in. Fast forward to the current times and the nuevo references in technology have changed drastically and they are digital transformation, chatbots, big data, machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, voice recognition, IOT, voice assistants etc. Of all the new tech today, the fast-emerging poster child called “Mr.AI” seems to have occupied a large mind space and is establishing its gargantuan presence across many spheres of life. Mr. AI’s Kafkaesque presence is being discussed, debated and attempts are being made to decipher this new thing-in-a-box and is capturing people’s interest beyond imagination. Last month, I heard my wife’s earnest advise to my son “You have to get a degree in AI and you will do well for yourself”. My dad, who is a doctor said “What is this AI all about? What will the doctors do in the near future?”. Teachers and Newspapers quote it almost every day. Not knowing what to do about it, Politicians and governments are talking about it and so are the millennials. Here is an interesting fact from a recent survey conducted on organizations by the supercomputer company Cray. 25% of the respondents consider AI to be critical, and another 77% believe it will become critical in the next three years? Really? Who do you think will be the ultimate beneficiaries of this largesse? I will now use my scratch-art to illustrate an over simplified viewpoint. From where I stand, the goal posts in technology are shifting rapidly and could leave behind a very large population exposed, confused and vulnerable. Will the creator be engulfed by his own creation? Loss of jobs, large scale exclusion, schism of societies, absolute redefinition of economic principles, are some points to ponder in days to come. Colossal changes that could soon bear down upon us are already underway in many working societies. As an example, one look at the manufacturing industry can tell tales of stress and duress and workforce reduction seems to be the new norm of an establishment. Countries with extensive workforces (both skilled and unskilled) are being faced with an arduous task of understanding the already complex human to machine relationships. The rules of engagement are being defined by the unknown faces of the future. I would like to bring your attention to another example which is fast changing the landscape of temporary workers across the globe. The Amazon Mechanical Turk — AMT (https://www.mturk.com) platform has been in existence for over a decade now and seems to have created slaves to the system by way of its click-workers. The concept of jobs-as-a-service has brought in disruptions in the job seeker market and potentially has taken away many basic rights of many click-workers who get paid very little money for their services. In turn, click-workers are training Mr.AI for pennies. Tech Republic’s story on AMT will give you a glimpse of the new world order to some extent. I think it’s time to pop the question. Are we really creating our own destroyers? Large populations of world have already been debilitated due to the imbalance of power and money in the hands of the few. Large corporations already wield enough power to change the rules of the game in the name of greed, profits and control. Large scale disruptions in lives of the people in bottom sections of the pyramid has led to civil unrest and disharmony. Could Mr.AI multiply these problems manifold OR alleviate the situation at hand? OR Is the Skynet really emerging beyond James Cameron’s imagination? In a true science fiction manner, the new battlefield is being readied by our-kind for our own defeat and possible annihilation. This Mr.AI conundrum needs strong views, plans and participation of the economists, philosophers, humanists, futurists, governments, regulators and may more thinkers to defeat the self-destructive technologist in this new war. The winner of this war could well determine the course of our future. Carl Sagan once said “Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known”. Well from where I stand today, this something incredible is definitely not the two-letter acronym that goes by the name Mr.AI. And finally, I want to leave you with my last image of Mr.AI we have come to be familiar with after Wachowski brothers gave us the never-ending quintessential Agent Smith. Can you feel it Mr. Anderson? Closing in on you? Oh I can, I really should thank you after all. It was, after all, it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. Purpose of life is to end. -- -- Not-so-Futurist. Almost a Realist. Don’t you think dreams and the internet are similar? They’re both areas where the repressed conscious mind vents.

Why 2020 Will Be a Desirable Year for Data Professionals,Let’s explore a few points about the big data: -,Michael lyam,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Michael lyam Follow -- 1 Listen Share Haven’t you heard? 2020 is going to be a year where there will be inextricably high demand for big data skills. Data scientists, data engineers, and data analysts with experience in Python, R, and SQL top the list. You may still think everyone knows what big data is by now, but you may still be wrong. Despite being the hottest buzzword for quite some time now, the misconception remains. Leaders and stakeholders realize that big data alone has no inherent worth. The true value lies in the information a big data professional extracts to answer a specific business question. · According to IDC, a mammoth of 163 zettabytes data a year to be generated by 2025. · A 2019 report “Future of Data Talent” by Correlation One projected US$15.7 trillion contributions to the GDP growth by 2030. These statistics reinstates that big data is here to stay and to proof that jobs in big data are increasing. One of the greatest reasons why mid-career professionals such as software engineers and web developers are switching to big data. Besides these professionals, freshers are now getting themselves acquainted with big data tools and techniques. The dearth of big data talent! Racing at breakneck speed, the growth of data has created new goals and challenges. Companies are now facing difficulty to build data teams to execute on their data strategies. Undifferentiated data talents in the big data space include data professionals such as professional data engineers and data scientists. Shortage of skills, poor anticipation, and antiquated talent assessment are hurdles companies need to overcome to find the perfect unicorn. · By 2020, there will be approximately 2.7 million newer data-related job postings in the U.S. · Expected 20% increase in the demand for data talent by 2020. · 40% of the companies fail to hire the right talent due to short supply. Although the demand for data professionals supersedes, there is unconscious bias. Top five skills you need to pick up to become a big data engineer 👉 Apache Spark — Apache Spark is crucial for data analytics. Apart from MapReduce which is complex, organizations are looking to expand their business operations by hiring big data professionals with skills in Spark. 👉Machine learning — The job market is still in need of professionals who can use machine learning to carry out predictive analytics. Companies such as Amazon, Spotify, and Amazon are seeking these engineers. 👉 NoSQL — NoSQL databases such as Couchbase and MongoDB have replaced traditional SQL databases such as Oracle and DB2 since they are better equipped with big data access and storage. 👉Apache Hadoop — Components such as Pig, HBase, Hive are seen to be in-demand by recruiters. 👉Setting up Cloud Clusters — Since big data offers reliability on networks, most of the task is outsourced to the cloud. To accommodate a wide volume of data, multiple clouds should be set up depending on the requirement of the company. Moving forward, an 🔗associate big data engineer certification program will help you embrace the skills and tools at the beginning of your data career. Big data engineering requires a lot more than just formal education. The current big data industry requires engineers to have a hybrid approach toward learning big data skills. Most data engineers generally own a Computer Science degree or Information technology degree which further parlayed through different vendor-specific certifications, independent certifications, and university big data certifications. Earning a credible certification could hugely impact your career in the big data world. There are few data-engineering specific certifications offered by various platforms today — Cloudera, The Data Science Council of America, eCornell, and SAS Academy, etc. Multiple engineers are opting for vendor-neutral platforms such as The Data Science Council of America . DASCA paints a pretty compelling picture for professionals looking to launch their careers in the big data field. It is easy to say but much more difficult to implement. Irrespective of where your skills and experience are today, this platform offers world-class certification programs to enter the world of data. At DASCA, every learning path ends with you being equipped for success in the chosen field.

https://medium.com/hitthebutton/the-environmental-impact-of-maritime-freight-726cbbdc4bdf?source=tag_archive---------55-----------------------,The Environmental Impact of Maritime Freight,"An overview of emissions, vessel discharge, and more",Kenny Jones,No Author URL,N/A,10 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Kenny Jones Follow Dynamo Tradewinds -- Listen Share The cargo shipping industry is massive. With the direct gross output of the industry totaling $183.3 billion, and with a compensation of $27.2 billion to the 4.2 million individuals directly employed by the industry, there are definite benefits to our global marketplace. Cargo transported through this industry equates to about two-thirds of total global trade, totaling $4 trillion worth in goods. Container shipping has made shipping cheap, as it lowered freight bills and saved time. However, this massive industry comes at a cost. The environmental impact of container shipping calls for innovative solutions to the most pressing environmental problems associated with the shipping industry. Emissions and IMO 2020 Due to the fuel used to power these cargo vessels, ships emit sulfur and nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon dioxide. Even though cargo ships are fuel-efficient, 80% of ships use heavy fuel oil, which is a more carbon-intensive type of fuel. These carbon emissions add up to approximately 3% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions, and are projected to increase to 20% of total global emissions by 2050 if we do not intervene. Nitrogen and sulfur oxide emissions from 2007–2012 represented 15% and 13% respectively of the global man-made emissions of these oxides. Although those statistics may seem daunting, there have been many policies to avoid a greater negative impact. First, a recent meeting of the U.N. International Maritime Organization (IMO), with a total of 173 countries, agreed to cut shipping emissions by 50% by 2050. But how are they planning on doing this? The first step to reduce emissions is a sulfur cap. On January 1, 2020 a cap on the sulfur content of cargo ship fuel will go into effect (known as IMO 2020). This will decrease the sulfur limit from 3.5% to 0.5%. Although this will cost a maximum of $30 billion, it will also result in reducing sulfur, particulate matter, and carbon emitted by cargo shipping significantly. Next, making ships increasingly energy efficient will help to decrease air emissions from cargo shipping. Since 2011, an Energy Efficiency Design Index led to the adoption of energy efficiency standards for newly built ships. Any ships built in 2013 or later are required to meet increasingly stringent fuel standards. These standards would help ships to reduce the amount of fuel they consume through new designs, reducing vessel speed, and building larger ships that can carry more cargo, therefore making ships more energy efficient per unit of cargo carried by the ship. It has also been estimated that through the use of new technology, alternative fuel, and renewable energy sources, the industry could utilize fuel without carbon by 2035 according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Below are some of the companies that are moving in this direction: Methanex, which produces marine grade methanol. This cost effective alternative fuel reduces emissions of sulphur oxides (SOx) by 99%, nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 60%, and particulate matter by 95%. These drastic decreases in emissions come from the fact that methanol is a naturally occurring gas and can be produced from renewable sources such as biomass and recycled carbon dioxide, as well as anything derived from pants. Unlike most alternative fuels, methanol is one of the top five chemical commodities shipped around the world annually. Meaning, that it readily available at most ports and its prices are typically lower than other fuels. IPCO Power, has designed an FID Injector that creates a stable water in fuel emulsion. This process adds distilled water to fuel onboard the vessel and creates a new fuel that has a more effective combustion. This higher efficiency fuel means lower fuel consumption, reduced NOx, HC, and PM pollutants, and will keep engine systems and scrubbers cleaner for longer. Eco Marine Power, is a Japan-based company that is looking for innovative ways to completely remove fuel consuming engines from vessels. Over the last few years, the company has been experimenting with the idea of solar panels that capture the power of the sun as well as energy from wind. These panels are as thin as cardboard and flexible like plastic. This new design is expected to cut emissions by up to 10%, which is around four tons of fuel saved every day on a large cargo ship. Through researching alternative fuels and propulsion systems, developing energy efficiency standards, creating energy efficient designs for new ships, and working on innovative technology to reduce emissions, the shipping industry is continuously working on decreasing the negative impact it has on the environment. Vessel Discharges Large cargo ships discharge ballast water, bilge water, gray water, and black water, all of which have the ability to decrease water quality, negatively impact aquatic environments, and increase risks to public health. Although ships discharge these at rates that fit with both international and national standards, they still pose an environmental threat. Gray water is water from the accommodation areas of ships including the shower and sink, laundry, and galley, whereas black water is sewage that contains feces and urine. Gray water can only be released from ships at least 1 mile from land or people in water, and 3 miles from an aquaculture lease. Bilge water is water that contains oil, and must be properly separated before being discharged. International agreements have required ships to have an Oil Water Separator to limit bilge water oil content to less than 15 ppm. These are all regulated through the EPA’s Clean Water Act National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Program, and created a vessel permitting program which contains federal standards for managing vessel discharge. Below are a few of the companies who are helping carriers meet EPA standards and clean up the discharge that their vessels produce. Alfa Laval’s “PureBilge” is a high speed centrifugal oily water separator that is able to reduce oil-in-water content to less than 5 ppm. This system is relatively smaller than most and can fit into almost any engine room. This separator incorporates a fully automated, computer based platform that constantly monitors water to oil levels to help carriers avoid any EPA or IMO fines. Genoil, is another company focused on helping vessels stay up-to-code with environmental laws and standards. Their “Crystal Sea Separator” is an automatic system that requires no filter or maintenance. It is also able to meet the gold standard of less than 5 ppm discharge levels, and can be used for a myriad of different applications such as fuel spills. Genoil has also established service centers all around the world, so vessels can make sure that their systems are constantly operational. Wartsila, and their “Super Trident” sewage treatment offer a cost-effective and safe answer to the disposal of waste at sea. The system is optimized for black and grey wastewater flows, and can be implemented into a vessel’s preexisting water treatment infrastructure. These compact systems can be installed between decks, and make outgoing water safe for release into the ocean. Invasive Species Aquatic invasive species are plants, animals, and pathogens that live in the water. They are not native to the area, and may flourish in the new environment they have been introduced into. They have been transplanted to these new environments by a variety of things, but shipping is one of the causes. Invasive species can cause ecosystem damage. The damages and costs of controlling invasive species is over $9 billion annually. These organisms can cause public health issues through toxic dinoflagellates and cholera bacteria. The way in which invasive species are transferred is through the discharge of ballast water from vessels and from hull fouling. Ballast water is water carried in ballast tanks of ships, as it helps to improve a ship’s stability and balance. It is taken into the ship and released when cargo is loaded and unloaded, and when there is poor weather in order to gain increased stability. When water is taken up in one area and discharged in another area, the transfer of nonnative species can easily occur. Every hour more than 2 million gallons of ballast water are released into U.S. waters, and over 3,000 marine species travel around the world in ballast water daily. The IMO, U.S. Coast Guard, and EPA regulate the discharge of ballast water in order to decrease the environmental impact caused by invasive species. The IMO has an environmentally protective numeric standard that a ship’s ballast water must be treated before it can be discharged, and has an implementation schedule for treatment systems in ships, ballast water management plans, requirements for sediment removal, and guidelines for new treatment technology. The Coast Guard created a federal treatment standard for cargo ships within U.S. waters that follow the standards presented by the IMO, which the EPA also adopted. The second way invasive species are transplanted is through hull fouling. Hull fouling is when organisms are attached to the outside of ships, and are therefore transplanted from one habitat to another. Examples of species that can attach themselves to the outside of ships include barnacles, mussels, sponges, algae, and more. These species can then come into contact with structures at the next port, or release larvae into the water. The surface area of ships that arrives within the U.S. annually is 2.5 times the area of Washington, D.C. meaning there is a lot of area on boats that organisms are able to attach onto. Ships can contain up to 90 tons of hull fouling. Without hull fouling control systems, fuel efficiency of cargo ships can be impacted by up to 40% due to an increase in drag, creating greater air emissions as well. Innovative hull coatings and cleaning solutions that deliver the greatest reduction in drag and prevent hull fouling will decrease both air emissions and the transplant of invasive species. LightTech LightSources, are a water treatment technology company that has built one of the preeminent ballast water treatment methods. Alongside their partners in the field, they have created a UV Radiation system that has proven most effective for eradicating any threatening invasive species. This system does not require any chemical treatments, and is a relatively low cost solution that has a small footprint inside a vessel’s hull. BIO-SEA, has combined two technologies into a single automated unit for the treatment of ballast water. Their system implements physical filtration such as screens and filters, plus UV filtration to ensure compliance with IMO standards. Not only does it disinfect the water it is treating, but it completely eliminates even the smallest of microorganisms. GEA Group, is one of the largest manufacturers of ballast water filtration systems in the world. Their “BallastMaster ultraV” is a highly efficient mechanical and physical system for treating ballast water capacities of up to 1000 cubic meters. Just like the aforementioned systems, this platform does not use any harmful chemicals, and is still capable of exceeding the IMO standard for disinfection. Marine Life and Habitats Not only is marine life impacted by invasive species, but also through an increase in the traffic of cargo ships causing injury to mammals spending time near the surface of the water. Marine life includes 78 species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises that spend a lot of time near the ocean surface. Vessel traffic causes these animals to be vulnerable to injury. In order to avoid the injury of these animals, the IMO has developed guidelines for operators to follow in hopes of avoiding water that is home to these animals. However, injury is not the only risk that marine life is facing. An increase in shipping traffic as the cargo shipping industry continues to expand causes an increase in the ambient level of marine noise. Researchers have grown concerned about how this increase in noise may affect mammal communications, breeding, and behavior. In order to combat these problems, the IMO has created marine protected areas that limit the activities allowed within these designated areas. ClearSeas, is an organization that was established to monitor the effects global shipping has on the environment. They work closely with carriers, ports, agencies, and startups to establish innovative ways of keeping our seas clean and wildlife safe. Through their research, they have countless heatmaps that detail marine life and habitat locations, and give clear instructions on how to preserve these protected areas. They are also a great resource for smaller vessels to get up-to-speed with current EPA and IMO regulations. Ocean Tracking Network, is a global aquatic animal tracking, data management, and partnership platform that uses electronic tags to track every kind of marine animal. Their data warehouses allow agencies and carriers to plan trade routes in a way that is safer for marine life and habitats. These up-to-date findings have helped reduce the number of annual boat strikes globally, as well as find better ways to keep animals safe who inhabit port areas. The ECHO program, is an initiative taken by the Port of Vancouver to help eliminate the sound pollution coming from large vessels. The noise generated by ships can disrupt travel routes and habitats of larger animals such as well. The Port of Vancouver and its partners have started using underwater listening devices to monitor ambient and underwater ship noise, as well as the presence of certain marine life. Through this research, the ECHO Program is hoping to work with carriers to make voluntary changes to shipping operations across the globe. These changes will allow vessels to run more efficiently through routes, and keep marine life out of harm’s way. The industry is taking the environmental impacts of cargo shipping seriously. Through initiatives like IMO’s 2020 and 2050 climate strategies, it is expected that greenhouses levels will decline drastically over the next 30 years, and shipping will be more cost effective across the board. There have also been improvements in both regulations and technology to help decrease vessel discharges, invasive species, and the negative impacts the industry can have on marine life. Shipping companies across the world are beginning to implement changes in order to mitigate the effects of shipping on the environment. This massive industry is working alongside chemical companies, agencies, and startups to develop innovative technologies in order to keep our seas and our air clean. -- -- A Blog on Supply Chain and Mobility from Dynamo Ventures Soon-to-be graduate who is currently working for DynamoVC as their Marketing Intern.

It sounds like a complicated profile- evasive, and coveted. Here we are, back with the breaking down the job description series to help you understand and prepare better for this role. You may haven’t noticed, but this is one of the major positions available in almost all the top IT companies in the world of technology. Who is responsible for converting the code to design? Who designs all the chips we take for granted? Welcome to the world of physical design. We design different algorithms through computer codes. But these computer codes are functionally right. To convert the algorithms to exact scenarios in the form of digital circuits- a new core comes into the picture called Digital Design. Digital design, in short, involves the usage of hardware description languages in converting the high-level algorithms into gate-level architectures. But it is also another incarnation of algorithmic coding. But physical design is a whole new domain- it is a new ball game altogether. In layman terms, Physical design deals with placing the logical building blocks of a circuit designed on a virtual breadboard. Sounds simple right? Maybe, if we want to build a simple adder. But consider making a 555 timer, oh well that sounds grueling. But the joy extends with the complexity of the challenge. The process involves a synthesizable circuit design as the input and a “ready for fabrication” design as output. Evidently, a physical design engineer is anonymous to a city planner. He/She plans the Integrated Circuit layout. The engineers typically work on processors, and controller architectures- called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (or ASICs). But it just does not end there. They go on to optimize the circuit up and beyond, trying to increase its performance, until the design breaks. The varied technologies- from the outdated 180nm to the currently trending 7nm are the bread and butter of a physical design engineer. These refer to the channel length of the transistors. Other responsibilities include the synthesis of clock trees for easy routing, reducing delays and clearing the glitches. The development of the IC starts with planning, placement, and routing (PnR) through the multiple metal layers. The constrained development environment allows the testing of different corner cases. The synthesizable hardware description code is known as the netlist which the physical design engineer takes as ignition. After PnR, the resistances and capacitances of the design are calculated using RC extraction. This allows for a calculation of the bandwidth, quality factor, corner points. The optimized output is called the layout of the design. Signing off takes verification of the layout and the packaging of the design. Companies usually look for relevant education in the field of electronics and computer architecture. A bachelor’s in - give a head start. But the bachelor’s degree does not give much insight. Relevant laboratory courses are non-existent. A master’s degree by thesis allows research and exposure to tools required. It also provides insight at abstract concepts. It is a true pleasure to look at the small MOS transistors revealing their actual forms. The foundation- analog electronics and VLSI with special focus on MOS transistors is a must. Knowledge of the ASIC design flow is important. The analytical study must include: Apart from these, a stronghold on the fundamentals of digital electronics and microprocessors is necessary. It is advisable to opt for advanced design courses if an opportunity presents itself- this could include advanced IC design, advanced VLSI, etc. The tools to be known are usually specific to the requirements. EDA vendors provide PnR tools for synthesis and optimization. Apart from that knowledge of HDL languages like Verilog is crucial. Tutorials are present for EDA specific tools in the respective vendor websites for reference. However, hands-on experience can be obtained only if the license is available. Usually, educational institutions have licensed machines available. Knowledge of Linux operating systems is an added advantage. Specific job positions to physical design are currently available in all leading corporations having a business in the ASIC industry. Given the challenges involved, it caters to stringent screening procedures. Here are some of the top companies in this field: The list goes on, and a quick LinkedIn job search would return you an ample of intriguing opportunities! Perseverance. Patience. These two in abundance always helps. It is challenging yet satisfying to create something which is eventually getting integrated into everyone’s day to day technology (like mobile phones) shortly. But with this comes a bout of responsibility. The ability to keep a serene mind and collective approach to solutions is the key. This work conditions the mind to usually approach towards a list of easy hacks. It does not always work. Tailor-made solutions are found to be advantageous. Play around with circuits. Circuits are dramatic and unpredictable until proven through observation. Get the creative cap on and try to think like a kid- having a limited space to accommodate all his toys without breaking any of them and retrieving them easily. Electronics is one of the enduring branches of science. Building a chip is every electronics student’s dream. If it is yours too, do not think twice before moving towards physical design engineering.

https://medium.com/digital-publishing-strategy/is-gafam-creating-a-walled-garden-in-educational-publishing-f5dfb0cf8cc9?source=tag_archive---------152-----------------------,Is GAFAM creating a walled garden in educational publishing?,Written by Georgina Smith,Georgina Smith,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Georgina Smith Follow -- Listen Share Technology companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft (GAFAM) have introduced a variety of hardware and tools for education including Google Chromebooks, Apple’s iPad and Microsoft Windows 10 laptops and tablets, as well as productivity tools such as Amazon Education Publishing and Facebook’s Summit Learning Platform. These all demonstrate how GAFAM are becoming disruptors in the educational market. However, this has raised the question as to whether educational publishing is becoming a technology business? If technology is taking over educational publishing, then there is a danger that GAFAM may create a walled garden situation. This is where companies such as Apple have their own hardware or software that restricts the user to just using this system. Some apps on Apple can only be purchased through their App store, or their software may only work on a Mac or an iPad. Thus, it is harder for the end-user to switch to another company’s products once they are heavily invested into Apple’s technology. Traditional educational publishers risk being locked out of these systems if GAFAM products and services are adopted by schools. So how can they compete with GAFAM? There have been attempts at collaborations with GAFAM to try to open up these walled gardens. In 2013 Google and Pearson promised to provide every K12 student of Los Angeles with an iPad loaded with Pearson content but this never materialised. These partnerships clearly do not always pay off, and instead it might be a safer option for educational publishers to create their own walled garden to compete directly with GAFAM players. An example of this can be seen in Pearson’s Power Maths project which promises teachers the best learning experience for their class. The idea being that the school can choose which package they want, with the starter package upfront cost being £3,997.00 and a yearly subscription of £1,074.60, which gives schools access to digital textbooks, print books and teacher resources. By Pearson providing all their content, teachers can save time in marking and preparing lessons as it is all set up by the publisher. The Department for Education placed the Power Maths KS1 on their list of recommendations thus highlighting the success of Pearson in providing premium quality content, which perhaps makes them more enticing compared to GAFAM who are relatively new to the educational sector. Undoubtedly, GAFAM have played a prominent role in educational publishing for a long time and their influence will only continue to grow in this market. For traditional publishers, creating their own forms of walled gardens could help prevent GAFAM forming an oligopoly scenario in educational publishing. The extent to which they restrict their software to their devices may vary, but it is up to the school to decide how far to invest and hand over control to these companies.

Reaching out to get a diverse set of speakers, panelist, go to contacts when stories/opinions and perspectives are needed on tech in general, not just “minority” tech. As for here in Washington DC, it is also about a consistent commitment from the community to support all of DC, including east of the river (look it up if you don’t know) and not always expecting individuals to go to the “in spot” or cool hip space, but to meet people where they are to build trust which then leads to the “community” that everyone says that they want… I have been part of DC tech, for over 15 years, started my own company Clearly Innovative Inc which just had its 10 year anniversary and I am 2 years into Inclusive Innovation Incubator (IN3).

The strange thing is that no matter what I do or say, you will always get it through the lens of a person of color in tech… which should be apparent to the audience So my tip is, when you are looking for someone to speak on being a “technologist” 1) In most cases you should look beyond your network because you probably have asked those people many times already. 2) That go to woman or person of color that you see on all the other panels that you think you be great on your panel, ask them to suggest a few people, lets gets some diversity within the diverse speakers 3) Just remember change in hard, we are in this situation because of a lot of things that happened long before you got on the scene so accept the challenges, the possibility that you will make mistakes, but listen and don’t get defensive when someone makes an observation that you are still in the “minority technologist” trap Check out more of my thoughts on In3Talks Podcasts and if you like videos, the YouTube Channel link is below. -- -- CEO Clearly Innovative Inc., www.clearlyinnovative.com + CEO Inclusive Innovation Incubator www.in3dc.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*IeDVaP9NxAsAqcBF_szXRg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*IeDVaP9NxAsAqcBF_szXRg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*IeDVaP9NxAsAqcBF_szXRg.jpeg"

https://medium.com/@sammyabdullah/investment-bankers-are-worth-the-fee-51515d8c9c6e?source=tag_archive---------95-----------------------,Investment bankers are worth the fee,Written by Sammy Abdullah,Sammy Abdullah,No Author URL,N/A,2 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sammy Abdullah Follow -- Listen Share If you need to raise a $15mm+ growth equity round, you may debate whether or not the banker is worth the cost. We did the math, and the short answer is the banker is well worth their fee. The typical fee for a banker raising a growth round will likely be a $50k up front retainer and 4% to 6% of the raise. In a $15mm growth round, that means a fee of nearly $800,000 if you include incidental expenses, which they’ll ask you to cover. While that may give you sticker shock, consider the following: 1. The banker will reach out to far more firms than you ever could while running your business. A good banker should reach out to 50 to 80 firms, most of whom will have warm relationships with the banker. 2. The banker will shepherd interested parties to the finish line in a coordinated, organized manner, making sure everyone submits their term sheets at the same time, setting up management meetings in the same week, and keeping everyone on the same timeline. This ensures no firm gets an unfair advantage and you’re able to evaluate all offers at one time versus piecemeal. This is critical. 3. The banker will act as the “bad guy” while you look like the good guy. They’ll play term sheets off each other, pressure firms to increase their bid and improve their terms, and do the gutter work the CEO shouldn’t. He’ll negotiate on your behalf so you can run the business and maintain friendly relations with all the investors. If the above isn’t enough to convince you, below is the math showing the value of the banker. Assuming a banker can get a 10% to 20% improvement in valuation versus what you could do yourself, if the company’s value increases by just 50% by the time you exit, that could be worth $8mm to $18m to the company. That’s well worth the banker fee, not to mention the fact they’ll optimize terms for you and allow you to focus on running the business while they do the dirty work. Selecting a good banker is critical and hard, and the difference between a great banker and a good banker is dramatic. A bad banker failing to raise the capital you need could imperil your business.

You can sign a mortgage. Make a big investment. Send a life changing email. Recently I took a risk, reached out to someone via email that I haven’t seen in ten years. And it’s crazy how simply sitting at your desk can get your heart pumping, send adrenaline coursing through your veins. A few sentences sat in a draft email for over a month, and every time I read them I felt a surge of excitement and dread. I’d think of it at random moments — driving in my car, feeding my cats, doing the dishes. And it always elicited the same, visceral response in me. After several weeks, I added the send address. After another few weeks, I finally clicked that button and sent it out into the universe. The moments before hitting that button were intoxicating — the feeling of having resolved to do something but not doing it yet. The imagined future and the real future crashing together. And the dizzying thought, once it was done: All I have to do is wait. For the rest of the day I kept my email open on my desktop, and felt the free fall excitement of suddenly seeing “inbox (1)” in the corner of the tab. I’d take a deep breath and stare at the screen. Yes. This is it. Get ready. Everything will change when you hit that tab. I’d see the letters that form the anticipated email address in my mind, black and bold in my inbox. And then the disorienting confusion of clicking the tab and seeing, instead: “Delta Air Lines — Jennifer, Earn 60,000 Bonus Miles for a Limited Time”. Day 2 there was still hope. It had been less than 24 hours, after all. Each email I received, I was sure was The Email. I imagined the other end of the message, a desk in the dark, a person laboring over the perfect response. On Day 3 I texted my best friend: What do you think is an acceptable amount of time to wait for an email response? She said 24 hours. By Day 4, when I saw that I had gotten a new email, the gut jerk excitement had subsided. I imagined in my mind all of the other emails it might be — a bill from my credit card company, a notification of a shipped package on Amazon, a receipt for a purchase. When I couldn’t come up with another email I was expecting, I allowed the hope to creep back in. But it was never the email I wanted. Day 5 I started looking at my email notifications casually, with almost no emotion. Before I clicked the tab, I’d tell myself it wasn’t the email I was expecting. And I believed it. But each time, I was still disappointed. Day 6 I started wondering if I’d emailed a defunct address. It’s been ten years, after all. Maybe my words are lost somewhere in the annals of the world wide web. So it fades away. I try to be rational, tell myself time is up. It’s just not going to happen. Move on. And of course, I think: It shouldn’t matter this much. But somehow, it does. -- -- Writing about the ideas I get stuck on 📝 Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*X8DbYfdC02MLQvqD9WeQRg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*X8DbYfdC02MLQvqD9WeQRg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*X8DbYfdC02MLQvqD9WeQRg.jpeg"

Los estafadores pueden elegir como blanco a las cryptomonedas para realizar actividades ilegales debido a su falta de regulaciones y control en la seguridad. Desafortunadamente, hay muchos usuarios que no pierden la oportunidad de estafar a millones y generar desconfianza en esta tecnología. La mayoría de las estafas tienen señales de advertencia claras y con un conocimiento básico y sentido común, los usuarios pueden ser más astutos que las estafas de cryptomonedas y proteger sus wallets, por eso es importante comprender los tipos de estafas más comunes en blockchain. Sigue leyendo para conocer las estafas de blockchain más comunes y cómo evitarlas. Los usuarios intercambian sus cryptomonedas / tokens en páginas de exchanges en la web, donde tienen sus inversiones en wallets. Estos exchanges proporcionan diferentes tipos de servicios, uno de ellos es dar acceso a múltiples cryptomonedas en una sola plataforma. Muchos gobiernos han impuesto regulaciones sobre estos exchanges (lea nuestro artículo de Medium para obtener más información sobre “Regulaciones aplicadas a las cryptomonedas en el mundo”) para garantizar que sus ciudadanos estén protegidos y que todos los exchanges sigan una lista de protocolos de seguridad, pero, por otro lado , hay muchos países que no tienen ningún tipo de regulación y el potencial de estafa se multiplica. Por lo general, los estafadores pueden desarrollar una aplicación de wallet o una página de exchange falsa donde las víctimas inocentes proporcionan sus claves privadas, es ahí donde comienza la estafa. Junto con el término de blockchain, es muy común escuchar sobre las ICOs (oferta inicial de monedas), lea nuestro artículo en Medium para saber más sobre este concepto “ Telos nace sin una ICO ni STO”. A través de las ICO, muchas empresas pueden recaudar fondos iniciales para sus proyectos. Cuando una ICO es fraudulenta, estas “compañías” crean sitios web falsos para que los usuarios depositen monedas, estos estafadores pueden ser un grupo de personas que se unen para la estafa. Hay muchos entusiastas de las cryptomonedas que desean invertir en esta nueva tecnología, pero no tienen el conocimiento o la información necesaria, es por eso que los estafadores se aprovechan de estas personas y los convencen de comprar una cryptomoneda que en realidad no existe. Por ejemplo, según Cointelegraph, el 80 por ciento de las ICO realizadas en 2017 fueron estafas. Los casos más comunes son el robo de tarjetas de crédito y detalles de cuentas bancarias, pero en el mundo blockchain, este concepto se refleja en el hurto de información de su wallet web o cuenta de exchange a través de piratas informáticos que infectan su computadora con un minero de cryptomonedas y reemplazan su dirección legítima o clave privada con una dirección del estafador. La pirámide crypto o el esquema Ponzi atrae a los nuevos inversores con la promesa de altos rendimientos al reclutar a más y más miembros para un proyecto específico, promoviéndolo como “libre de riesgos” para las inversiones. El objetivo es convencer a tantos inversores como sea posible y el miembro recibe un “retorno” que proviene de nuevos inversores, esta acción satisface a los inversores iniciales, creyendo en la legitimación del proyecto, pero lo que realmente está sucediendo es que estas personas están siendo estafadas, pero sin saberlo son alentadas a invertir más y más dinero creyendo que van a tener más ganancias, alentando a otros a hacerlo, hasta que el esquema se derrumbe. Si desea invertir en cryptomonedas, lo primero que debe hacer es investigar la reputación de una crypto en específico, conocer a sus inversores, conocer su white paper, entre muchas otras informaciones importantes. Telos Blockchain es una de las blockchain más seguras y transparentes en la actualidad, si desea obtener más información al respecto, lea nuestro artículo de Medium “Telos, el futuro de la seguridad del blockchain”, con un token muy valioso y una comunidad muy comprometida.

Smart home technology is yet to be fully adopted by consumers and remains largely the preserve of early adopters. The problem is that most companies are taking a product-focused rather than a human-centric approach and they are not getting a comprehensive view of people’s needs in the home. New research by The Dock — Accenture’s global R&D and flagship innovation center — is a new way of looking at how people live in their homes today so that companies can build a strategy for success in the future home Bringing together a multi-disciplinary team at The Dock , we designed a program of research and experimentation to challenge the conventional approach to product design and marketing for the smart home. We wanted to ask fundamental questions such as who are the customers for the future home? What do they really want? And how do companies overcome people’s key contemporary concerns about how their data is collected and used? We combined detailed qualitative research with substantial quantitative research to dig deep into the complexities of how people live at home. We also built a set of eight mindsets that covers a diverse spectrum of personality and attitudes towards technology in the home, and gives executives a new foundation on which to build success in the future home. 40 people directly observed in their homes through contextual enquiry 6,050 individuals surveyed across 13 geographies Our findings give companies a new perspective from which to design and build products and services that transform the future home from a remote futuristic concept to a relevant human reality. Based on this work, we’ve reached three main conclusions. 85% of respondents now spend the same amount or more time at home as they did five years ago 43% of respondents aged 18 to 34 are fearful that smart devices know too much about them, indicating that their deepest concerns are around trust and intrusiveness despite being perceived as a more tech-savvy generation 25% respondents aged 65+ are worried about the addictive nature of technology, the lowest figure across all age groups The issues uncovered by this research are fundamental to any product design and marketing strategy for the smart home. Our research on tensions shows that people are resigned to the fact that they need to share their personal data in order to use certain smart-home products and services, but they struggle with this reality. The companies that go beyond data protection and earn their trust by combining true relevance with a rationalization of these tensions will be the pioneers of success in this space. open.spotify.com There is a significant opportunity to develop a future home offering that’s built to last, reinforced by the presence of several untapped markets in the space.

Now, he is a Student Research Scientist at Nokia Bell Labs, the historic birthplace of revolutionary innovations. He has a long list of accolades and accomplishments that go with his profile. He has been a finalist and winner at numerous global challenges and contests, including Unity India #FreedomWithUnity Contest, MHacks Nano, KPIT, Ideathon hosted by Kerala Startup Mission, Ideation BootCamp hosted by Enterpreneurship Cell, NIT Trichy, and was chosen as a Singapore Youth Peacemaker in 2016 by the World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF). He has also been awarded the Scholarship for S.T.E.A.M School, Makers’ Asylum and was a participant at HackMIT, RealityVirtuality Hackathon, PennApps, HackUPC hosted by MIT, MIT Media Labs, Univ. of Pennsylvania and MIT Emerging World 2017. Maybe we could just ask him. Presenting the second story from TinkerHub about young achievers and their success stories that begin with a technology learning culture — How Asking the Right Questions took Sanket Thakur from MOOCs to Facebook to Bell Labs! Read our first story here: How a Girl from Kochi went from Struggling for Parents’ Permission to Attend a Hackathon to Becoming a Google WTM Scholar! featuring Ann Philip. Join us as we interview one of the first members of TinkerHub Community! I had a lot of expectations about college. ‘These are going to be the golden years of my life’, or so I thought. You know, the movie waali feeling. But reality is so different from your expectations right? Painfully so. College was very boring and nothing was happening instead of stupid assignments which even teachers knew we would copy from the internet. I used to procrastinate a lot on my own. Then I started with MOOCs and did some basic projects (catch some of them here!) but I always felt something was missing. It was at the end of the year that some of the seniors and all of us students gathered together and started TinkerHub, a community to promote learning technology. It was very small at the beginning, but something is better than nothing. I still remember Jibin Jose as the first speaker, sharing his experience. I was literally amazed by the things the guy had done! Thanks to him, I got to know about challenges and competitions like hackathons. TinkerHub started with the idea of bringing like-minded people together, get to know about each other’s experiences and try to build our LinkedIn profile (that’s where I first got to know about it!). The meetings, seminars and classes by TinkerHub were always a treasure trove of knowledge. They motivated us to do something ourselves. So I did a breakout of my plan and every semester I would focus on one thing. 1st year — I learned from MOOCs and TinkerHub sessions. 3rd semester — I started building projects. 4th semester- I tried to give some talks, or you could say I tried networking. Thus I used to grow bit by bit through every semester that passed. Every year I would start doing something new and different from the previous semester. I always had a dream to earn some money while in college, through competitions. I decided to go for hackathons and challenges. God, I was so nervous for my first hackathon! I had always made some projects on my own, but never built something with a team. My biggest concern was “What will happen if I am not able to build something ?” The seniors gave me great support. They would always say, “Don’t worry, it’s all good.” It is from that point onward that you could find me easier at hackathons than in classrooms. I mostly spent every weekend in Bangalore. My parents didn’t know about it though! I still remember when I bought my first Xbox with hackathon money! That was the best feeling ever. I never actually got any support from my college. Once I got a chance to work on a project by Samsung Research in America and I had to spend some time in Bangalore. There was another time when I was selected for a competition at MIT (I had been applying for it since my 2nd year and I finally got selected in my 4th year). But teachers won’t let me go because I had attendance issues! For them attendance mattered more. Even the college administration turned a blind eye to me. In my 3rd year, CUSAT Launchpad was held and my team won the competition. Although it didn’t work out later on, I started my own company with support from Singapore. I went to Singapore! It was also a dream of mine to go abroad at least once while in college. In fact I had these small small dreams before coming to college, like winning competitions, earning money, going abroad. It held a very special value for me. In 2016 when I was at the peak of my excitement and interests I applied for a competition called Bell Labs Prize. I wasn’t selected for the finals but I did get to meet some of the people from Bell Laboratories. So yeah, as you can see, I started with MOOCs, did some projects, did some networking, went to competitions, tried starting a company (unsuccessfully) and now I am doing research at Bell Laboratories! I never thought I would end up here. It’s like ‘living the dream’. Yes, I feel really nostalgic. It’s amazing to see what TinkerHub has grown into. When Jibin came up for the very first talks session and everybody was keenly listening to him, I thought “One day I wanna be like him. I want people to hear me when I speak and I want to share my challenges and experiences.” That was my motivation. It’s like when people say, “Motivation can come from anything, you just have to keep searching.” At college, I didn’t have many friends and I used to feel lonely. To most people, I was someone who regularly missed classes, did not perform well in exams and would not be able to sit in the interviews. But there was an upside. I would watch some tutorials and build something from what I know and post it on Instagram and Facebook. I loved it when people would react or comment on something I had built. That was my motivation too, and that kept me eager to learn something new everyday. Yeah it was great! I used to see a lot of MOOCs. But getting to make a MOOC, that’s one hell of an experience. I was working with a huge team of students from across India. It was intimidating at first but it was good. I was never like a mentor to them. I used to talk with students very casually. But sadly I couldn’t attend the final VR day. It was honestly a great experience for me and one that not many get to have. I am thankful to SV team and Facebook for offering me the opportunity. Yes, I faced a lot of trouble. Especially in my networking focused semester. I was flustered as to how I would connect with people. If I had question, how could I directly ask anyone? I was never good at the preliminary conversations. But I later realized that people like it when you directly come to the point. Let me tell you. All this, the Facebook thing, my Singapore Startup, Bell Labs, all came from a single question. ‘ Can I ?’ And that did the magic ! Can I be a part of an FB course? Can I work with you to build something for clients at Singapore? Can I work at Bell Labs ? It would seem really philosophical coming from me. But that’s the reality today. Unless you ask, you will never know ! It was on the Diwali day, 7th November 2018 that I got a mail with the subject ‘Opportunity at Bell Labs’. I responded with no hesitation and was scheduled for an interview with three other scientists and thankfully it all went well. I literally cried when I got the call of appointment! And it sometimes makes me wonder, what if I hadn’t mailed that person? What if I hadn’t asked him if I could get into Bell Labs? But I asked. And sometimes, all it takes to get your dreams is just to ask. I never thought research could be this interesting. I am always working on some problem that we common people wouldn’t even think of. I would tell myself to never be afraid to ask questions. Whatever I achieved, wherever I have been to, it has always been because I was not hesitant to ask the right questions. And that would be the advice I would give to all the young engineers or innovators and the younger me. Well, we need to remember that this cool, totally chilled-out Sanket that you just saw in this interview has had to make his share of sacrifices in order to get where he wanted to be. As always, first you need the dream. Then the vision. And an action plan for the mission. So that’s a wrap. We hope Sanket’s story has been able to trigger your innovative spirits!

https://theiotmagazine.com/how-iot-is-powering-cashless-retail-2fd0f9a2c8a1?source=tag_archive---------77-----------------------,How IoT is Powering Cashless Retail,Published in The IOT Magazine,KaylaMatthews,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in KaylaMatthews Follow The IOT Magazine -- Listen Share You can think of them as a kind of store of the future — all you have to do is walk in, grab what you need, and walk out. And without talking to anyone or even stopping to scan your items, you’ll be automatically charged for the things you take with you. It’s a new model of retail, called cashless retail, where customers don’t need to wait in line or use cash to shop, and it’s being made possible by the latest advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The foremost pioneer in cashless retail is tech giant Amazon, who recently opened their cashless convenience store, Amazon Go. Inside, Amazon’s Walk Out technology — a network of smart cameras and smart-shelf sensors — track customers as they move through the store and log the products that they pick up. When a customer leaves the store, they automatically charge for the items they take with them, without needing to wait in line, talk to a cashier, or even interact with a screen. Amazon Go is one of the ways retailers are combating one of the biggest causes of lost retail profits: long lines. An estimated $37.7 billion is lost each year when customers choose to walk out rather than waiting for a cashier. Retailers are hoping that IoT and cashless offerings can recover some of these lost profits. However, the technology needed to run cashless stores may not be quite there yet. Amazon planned to launch 56 stores across the country by the end of 2019, but so far only 15 have materialized. It’s not clear why this slowdown has happened — best guesses include difficulty scaling up the Just Walk Out technology and fear that customers will be slow to adopt the checkout-free stores outside of major city centers. Several other smaller startups and retailers have followed Amazon’s lead and launched their cashless convenience stores. In August of 2018, tech startup Zippin launched a cashless store in San Francisco. But the most significant advances in IoT and cashless retail outside of Amazon Go have been abroad, in China, where Alibaba and Jd.com have launched their cashless convenience stores and cafes. These stores work on the same principles as other cashless retailers, using smart shelves, phone scanners, and cameras to track customers and charge them automatically when they leave the store. In August, convenience chain 7-Eleven piloted their cashless stores, which were closer to smart vending machines than Amazon’s high-tech offering. In cases like Amazon’s checkout-free store, vast amounts of customer data — their payment info, product preferences, and even what they look like — will need to be collected and stored by IoT sensors. A breach of that data could be disastrous — both for Amazon and its customers. The average cost of a data breach is $7.5 million. That number could be even higher for cashless retailers, given the sensitivity and value of the data their IoT devices will collect. Another downside of cashless retail is that, while convenient, these stores will effectively lock out customers who can only pay in cash. The backlash against cashless retailers even prompted Philadelphia to ban cashless retailers in early 2019 and require that all stores accept legal tender. And it’s not clear how much of the theoretical $37.7 billion lost each year to long lines would come from customers who both hate long lines and only pay in cash. Finally, security may also be an issue for cashless retailers. Consumer IoT devices are notorious for being difficult to secure, and cybersecurity solutions that specifically target IoT devices are few and far between. As with any new technology, cashless retail has hit some stumbling blocks. And the project also faces the difficulty of securing the massive amounts of data these stores collect. But retailers are almost sure to continue pursuing the dream of cashless stores so long as customers keep to avoid cashiers and ditch long lines.

Three notable cherry-picks in 10 minutes. Have you been hacked yet? No? Good. Yes? Well, … Security breaches are all over the news. Hardly a day goes by without headlines such as a spicy Company XYZ hacked, offline for two days, approx. $10m damage, a whopping User Account Data leaked — Tens of Thousands of User Credit Card Information Circulating Among the Dark Web, or potentially a more or less unsettling New study warns that smart light bulbs could allow hackers to steal your personal data. The latter might not only contribute to a sly smile, but also foster concern over the usage of specific products. Although an increasing amount of news articles regarding security threats can be observed and should raise awareness, the number of both end users and companies that fall victim to malware is growing. Often, the upfront work seemed either too complicated or expensive. Avoiding complex passwords appears to be one of the famous main problems of users among others. Companies face even more difficult challenges as they inherit all of their employees’ weaknesses and additionally attract more bad guys who try to secure their “funds” and look for the big fish, possibly by hooking smaller ones first. In this article, I present to you three security incidents that impressed me, each with its own specific focus. Stuxnet, WannaCry and Heartbleed are briefly outlined as examples of how dangerous, yet subtle some pieces of software can harm your company, your machines or possibly even you. One of the most common types of malware (malicious software) is the worm — a stand-alone, self-distributing computer program. Besides the famous Morris worm as one of the very first computer worms to ever gain public attention, a sophisticated example of what a worm can do is… Being only half a megabyte in size, Stuxnet became famous for its attack on an Iranian nuclear facility in 2010. It gained access to the facility via USB according to the most popular theories. An infected USB drive was inserted into a computer and marked the beginning of the end. Notably, Stuxnet removed itself from said USB drive the moment it infected the machine, leaving no traces of its origin whatsoever. Starting from the freshly infected computer, Stuxnet is able to spread itself within the network and escalate its access rights. Its destination systems are Siemens PLCs which control the machinery (e.g., centrifuges) in the facility. In addition to covering past traces, this smart worm had multiple methods in place to ensure it stayed undetected at the time of operation. I’m trying not to get too technical here, but it hid from antivirus software by referencing non-existent files. Normally, these would generate error messages. However, Stuxnet hijacked a process which maps these file names to system memory containing the encrypted malicious code pieces. It then decrypted the harmful part on demand. The combination of these two steps allowed Stuxnet to bypass the antivirus software. But hold on, it becomes even more interesting. Stuxnet managed to infect many devices within the network and gain sufficient control rights to do as it pleased. Instead of tripling the centrifuges rotation speed and trying to destroy the machinery with a single strike, Stuxnet took its time to ensure it infected enough systems. It then changed the rotation speeds of the centrifuges only slightly and increased the pressure of a gas involved in the enrichment process only by a bit. Although it did not immediately destroy the machines, these slight changes did not trigger alerts or were recognized as being dangerous by the workers. One of these changes at a time surely would not hurt, but the combination of many slight changes here created a big difference. Stuxnet even recorded and replayed the last seconds of correct functionality on the monitors. Not a single screen showed a problem, no alert was triggered. No worker standing beneath a centrifuge could see or hear a difference. Rapid, large changes might lead to an automatic safety shutdown or someone pressing a “system security breach” button, immediately powering off the endangered systems. Stuxnet took this into consideration. It chose the — from an attacker point of view — safer and more subtle way, ultimately destroying two fifths of the centrifuges. Now, the above true story shows how subtle and sophisticated worms can reach their creator’s goals. Likely, the intention here was only to destroy the machinery and not hurt innocent workers. These could see the centrifuges failing when it was too late and seek a safe distance. Immediately raising the rotational speed of the machines might lead to injuries or possibly even worse outcomes which Stuxnet ultimately avoided. Another famous piece of code focuses on a greater group of potential victims than Stuxnet does: all Windows machines, not only those running within nuclear facilities. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome our next guest: The cryptoworm WannaCry followed other intentions than Stuxnet. Whilst Stuxnet focused on destroying (parts of) a nuclear facility and might be state-sponsored, WannaCry was about making money and celebrated its uprising in 2017. Comparable to most other ransomwares, this one also encrypts the hard drive and holds all data for ransom. The lump sum of $300 to $600 (depending on how fast victims reacted) had to be paid in bitcoin, promised the decryption of all files, and therefore the release of the possibly important or even business critical data. However, other than most ransomwares, WannaCry is not a trojan, but can be classified as a worm: It spread without user interaction, and through that was able to gain even more reach than many other crypto trojans. WannaCry used a Windows exploit called EternalBlue which already had been fixed and patched at the time. However, many users, especially in the business context, did not update their systems in the meantime and still fell victim to this worm. Public resources such as BBC pointed out the ransom should not be paid and payment might not lead to the desired effect. However, many transactions to the attacker’s bitcoin wallets could be observed within the few days before being emergency-patched, totaling more than a hundred thousand US-Dollar at the time. Almost a quarter million infected devices, a six-digit USD of ransom payments and total damages in the hundreds of millions later, the EternalBlue exploit was eliminated through an emergency patch by Microsoft. Although this did not recover the damages already done, it protected all patched systems from being infected in the future. The next vulnerability affected even more users than WannaCry did and was existent for an even longer duration. Meet… Our final troublemaker is called Heartbleed and was neither a worm nor a trojan. It was a bug in 2012’s OpenSSL protocol update which enabled potential attackers to steal normally protected data. It has not been fixed for two more years and was publicly discovered and fixed in April 2014. The Heartbleed vulnerability ranks as one of my top three, because it potentially affects everyone using the internet: it did not target an explicit operating system, but a protocol used for communication. Heartbleed enabled an attacker to retrieve the encryption keys of the server’s traffic. This means said attacker could listen to the victim’s connections and decrypt them entirely, or even pretend to be the server and play man-in-the-middle (i.e., communicating with victims, leaving them with no hint it actually is the attacker responding). The entire communication between the victim and most common websites could be eavesdropped. The best thing: the end user could do nothing about it. Heartbleed abused a function of the OpenSSL protocol. To verify the server is still active, a user sent a phrase to the server and requested the first N letters of this phrase to be sent back, with N usually being the length of the phrase. This worked well as a verification, and could be abused even better. Consider the following situation: You tell the server to sent back the first 30 letters of the phrase “dog”. You would expect an error or only receiving the three existing letters. However, servers using the affected version of OpenSSL would now send back “dog” and all the following symbols in memory up to the requested amount. Our output might look like this: “dogChristiansMasterKeyIs123456”. (P.S.: It’s not, probably) The following xkcd comic does a great job in further depiction of the scenario: Imagine the possibilities an attacker abusing Heartbleed had for two years. Login information, credit card details, online banking PIN — nothing is protected by the otherwise strong encryption of all internet traffic nowadays. Fun fact: The name Heartbleed originates from the name of the feature’s initial implementation — Heartbeat. I hope this article presents past issues in security in an understable way. Some attacks use highly sophisticated methods, possibly years of engineering and precise planning; others work as simple as “send me the first 300 letters of the following phrase: potato”. Thank you for reading. I want to close with a possibly familiar question and a final thought: Have you been hacked yet? No? To put it with the famous words of former FBI director Robert Mueller: There are two types of companies: those who have been hacked, and those who don’t yet know they have been hacked.

The attack came in the form of a $5 billion dollar fine levied against social media behemoth Facebook, the abrupt culmination of a 16-month long investigation by the FTC. More than just a loud conclusion of a single investigation, the fine rode the current of now years worth of brooding public outrage over the company sparked by the infamous Cambridge Analytica scandal and kept aflame by near-weekly privacy violations, corporate malpractice, and plain societal degradation at the hands of a handful of tech companies we have all willingly, and unwillingly, welcomed into every facet of our daily lives. For an optimist, the fine represents red hot embers set to engulf a kindling of complaints levied against these companies long left unexplored or under-realized.

Blog Tiếng Việt -- 1 Share Tác giả: Shannon Appelcline Công nghệ blockchain khởi nguồn từ sổ cái Bitcoin, bắt đầu từ ngày mồng 3 tháng 1 năm 2009, tính đến nay đã được hơn mười năm. Đó vẫn được coi là một khoảng thời gian ngắn khi nhắc tới một lĩnh vực mới trong ngành công nghệ máy tính. Nó giống như việc chúng ta nhắc tới cơ sở dữ liệu trong những năm 1970, trước khi có sự ra đời của mô hình cơ sở dữ liệu quan hệ, hay ngôn ngữ truy vấn cấu trúc, hoặc internet sử dụng bộ giao thức TCP/IP vào năm 1993, chỉ một vài năm sau khi chúng ta biết tới khái niệm trang web. Là một lĩnh vực mới mẻ, sẽ không có gì đáng ngạc nhiên khi ngày nay chúng ta vẫn đang trong quá trình khám phá nó theo các hướng khác nhau để tìm ra hướng thiết kế và sử dụng một cách hiệu quả nhất các sổ cái đồng thuận bất biến với vai trò là một phương pháp thu thập và lưu trữ thông tin hoàn toàn mới. Chúng tôi vẫn đang cố gắng định hình xem triết lý của công nghệ blockchain là gì, và nó sẽ nên là gì. Một trong những câu hỏi kỹ thuật được đặt ra cho công nghệ blockchain hiện nay là về tính đồng thuận: làm thế nào để bạn quyết định những gì có thể được đưa lên blockchain? Bạn có cách nào để đảm bảo rằng hệ thống blockchain được xây dựng công bằng và giữ được tính bất biến? Câu hỏi này đã và đang được nghiên cứu qua lăng kính của Bài toán Các vị tướng Byzantine (The Byzantine Generals’ Problem), trong đó yêu cầu sự đồng thuận của các “vị tướng” được chọn, mặc dù một số trong đó có thể là đối thủ. Một hệ thống được coi là đạt trạng thái Chịu Lỗi Byzantine (Byzantine Fault Tolerant) nếu nó có thể giữ được tính đúng đắn ngay cả khi một vài phần trăm các thành phần của nó bị hư hỏng. Các giải pháp truyền thống cho vấn đề này đã có từ trước blockchain: thuật toán Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) đạt được sự đồng thuận thông qua việc các thành viên trong cộng đồng tham gia vào nhiều vòng bỏ phiếu, cho tới khi họ đạt được thỏa thuận đầy đủ — ngay cả khi một vài thành viên không phản hồi hoặc phản hồi một cách ác ý. Đó là một giải pháp đột phá, tuy nhiên vẫn có những hạn chế nghiêm trọng: do những yêu cầu giao tiếp rộng rãi, pBFT yêu cầu một số lượng hạn chế những người tham gia được thiết lập trước: bạn có thể có rất nhiều các vị tướng, nhưng họ đều phải được biết đến từ trước. Mặc dù vấp phải những hạn chế trên, thuật toán pBFT (hoặc các biến thể tương tự) đã được sử dụng trong một số hệ thống blockchain được cấp phép. Tính đồng thuận liên kết (federated consensus) được sử dụng bởi mạng Liquid của Blockstrem là một ví dụ điển hình. Đó là một mạng riêng, nơi các sàn giao dịch tiền điện tử kết hợp cùng nhau để hỗ trợ việc chênh lệch giá giữa các công ty của họ, từ đó cho phép các giải pháp ủy quyền được thực hiện suôn sẻ. Cũng như vậy, hệ thống blockchain Hyperledger Fabric được xây dựng dựa trên thuật toán pBFT. Tuy nhiên, Satoshi Nakamoto nhận ra rằng cần có các giải pháp hoàn toàn khác nhau cho các blockchain công khai không cần cấp phép (permissionless public blockchain) được xây dựng trên các giao dịch “truthless”. Do đó, một trong những cải tiến lớn nhất của Bitcoin chính là giao thức đồng thuận “Nakamoto Consensus” của ông. Giao thức này chứa nhiều yếu tố, bao gồm: lựa chọn người đề xuất khối — block proposer selection — (trong đó có một người được trao cơ hội để đề xuất một khối) và phép lồng khối — block inclusion — (trong đó một khối được thêm vào một chuỗi mà chuỗi đó có thể được trở thành chuỗi chính hoặc không, tuỳ thuộc vào một quy trình xử lý ngẫu nhiên). Một số người cũng coi sự khan hiếm và các cấu trúc trao thưởng của Bitcoin là một phần của giao thức. Chính yếu tố đầu tiên trong giao thức Nakamoto Consensus, về việc lựa chọn người đề xuất khối đã thu hút sự chú ý của mọi người, và điều đó thúc đẩy cho nhiều cuộc tranh luận về tương lai của blockchain, bởi đó chính là yếu tố cốt lõi cho ý tưởng về các permissionless blockchain như Bitcoin (Permissionless blockchain hay Public blockchain là những hệ thống blockchain cho phép người dùng tạo các địa chỉ cả nhân, gửi các giao dịch lên blockchain và ghi vào sổ cái. Ngoài ra các bên tham gia có thể lựa chọn tự chạy một node hoặc sử dụng các giao thức mining để xác minh các giao dịch). Về mặt kỹ thuật, bạn có thể chọn một đề xuất khối thông qua cơ chế lựa chọn ngẫu nhiên hoặc quay vòng. (Trên thực tế, thuật toán pBFT sử dụng cơ chế quay vòng). Cơ chế này thuận lợi cho việc hoạt động của các permissioned blockchain (permissioned blockchain hoạt động như một hệ sinh thái khép kín, nơi người dùng không thể tự do tham gia vào mạng, xem lịch sử giao dịch hay phát hành các giao dịch), tuy nhiên nó lại nhanh chóng sụp đổ trên permissionless blockchain, khi mà kỳ ai cũng có thể tạo ra vô số tài khoản để gia tăng khả năng anh ta được đề xuất các khối. Kết quả là, giao thức Nakamoto Consensus cần đến cơ chế phòng thủ Sybil để ngăn ngừa việc giành được lợi thế trong tính đồng thuận bằng cách lập ra nhiều tài khoản. Đó là những gì một phương thực lựa chọn người đề xuất khối tốt sẽ làm. Hai cơ chế phòng thủ Sybil được chú ý hơn cả là: proof of work và proof of stake, và cả hai cơ chế này đều quản lý Sybil bằng cách làm cho chúng trở nên đắt đỏ. (Ngoài ra còn có các cơ chế lựa chọn người đề xuất khác như proof of activity, proof of authority, proof of burn, và proof of capacity, tuy nhiên chúng chưa nhận được sự quan tâm bằng hai loại cơ chế nêu trên). Mặc dù cơ chế proof of work là cơ chế phòng thủ Sybil nguyên thủy của Satoshi Nakamoto, cơ chế proof of stake lại nhanh chóng có được chỗ đứng cho mình. Ngày nay, thậm chí còn có những hệ thống kết hợp cơ chế proof of stake với các hệ thống BFT truyền thống — ví dụ như hệ thống EOS blockchain sử dụng proof of stake để bầu ra các “vị tướng”, những người sau đó sẽ tham gia vào việc bầu BFT để đạt được sự đồng thuận. Vậy hai hệ thống phòng thủ Sybil nổi tiếng nhất này hoạt động ra sao? Proof of work là phương pháp phòng thủ Sybil truyền thống trên một blockchain, được Bitcoin và Ethereum (ngày nay) sử dụng. Mỗi người tham gia được trao cơ hội để giải một bài toán. Bất kỳ ai giải được bài toán đều được phép đề xuất một khối cho blockchain, góp phần tạo sự đồng thuận và góp phần vào sự phát triển của sổ cái. Hệ thống phòng thủ Sybil được tạo ra dựa trên thực tế rằng rất khó để thực hiện các phép toán đó, vì vậy cần tiêu tốn năng lượng để giải quyết nó. Proof of stake là một hệ thống phòng thủ Sybil mới hơn, được đưa vào sử dụng đầu tiên bởi Peercoin và đang được Ethereum nghiên cứu để đưa vào những sản phẩm trong tương lai. Trong cơ chế này, một người tham gia ngẫu nhiên sẽ được chọn để tạo ra một khối mới dựa trên “cổ phần” của họ trong hệ thống, thường được tính theo số lượng tiền điện tử họ sở hữu, hoặc thời lượng họ sở hữu số tiền điện tử của mình. Nói cách khác, người tham gia có thể được chọn một cách ngẫu nhiên để tạo ra các khối nếu họ có rất nhiều tài sản kỹ thuật số hoặc có rất nhiều tài sản kỹ thuật số đã tồn tại trong thời gian dài; đây là yếu tố cốt lõi giúp ngăn chặn những kẻ tấn công tạo ra quá nhiều các tài khoản Sybil. Các cơ chế chứng minh cổ phần ban đầu cho rằng các cổ đông vốn được khuyến khích tạo ra các khối chính xác, tuy nhiên việc này tạo cơ hội cho một số kiểu tấn công, nên các hệ thống sau này củng cố bảo mật bằng cách gia tăng hình phạt: nếu người tham gia hệ thống có liên quan tới những giao dịch gian lận, họ sẽ mất một phần cổ phần của mình cũng như khả năng tạo ra các khối trong tương lai. Mỗi hệ thống đều có những ưu điểm và nhược điểm; tuy nhiên, để thực sự đánh giá xem phương pháp nào là tốt nhất cho cộng đồng blockchain thì chúng ta cần quay trở lại khởi điểm và xem xét lại nền tảng triết lý của công nghệ. Trong những năm gần đây, các cuộc tranh luận liên quan tới Bitcoin đều tập trung vào giá của nó, trong khi các cuộc tranh luận rộng hơn về blockchain lại tập trung vào những vấn đề liên quan tới công nghệ. Tuy nhiên tất cả đều đã bỏ qua một câu hỏi quan trọng: tại sao công nghệ blockchain lại được tạo ra. Sách trắng gốc về Bitcoin của Satoshi Nakamoto nặng về công nghệ vè nhẹ về triết lý, tuy nhiên nó cung cấp một vài manh mối với những tranh luận về mạng lưới “ngang hàng” và về việc rời bỏ hệ thống “quản lý tập trung”. Nguyên tắc của Bitcoin là trao quyền lực cho mọi người, để họ có thể giao dịch tiền tệ mà không cần phụ thuộc vào một tổ chức hay nhà nước nào. Như vậy, đó là sự phát triển vượt bậc của các cypherpunk, những người đã hoạt động trong việc tìm kiếm các giải pháp tiền điện tử trong thời gian dài. Họ ủng hộ quyền riêng tư và đấu tranh chống lại sự kiểm soát cũng như kiểm duyệt của chính phủ. Nền tảng triết lý của công nghệ blockchain có thể dễ dàng bắt nguồn từ sự giao thoa giữa lý tưởng của các cypherpunk với công nghệ phi tập trung và mạng ngang hàng của Nakamoto. Sự giao thoa ý tưởng này đã gợi ý về một thế giới mà ở đó mọi con người đều bình đẳng; một nơi mà bất kỳ ai cũng có cơ hội để đóng góp cho sự đồng thuận, và là nơi họ đều có thể tương tác trên một sân chơi bình đẳng. Nó nói về việc đảo ngược các xu hướng đa nguyên và chuyên quyền của thế giới vật chất, nơi chỉ một số ít người có tầm ảnh hưởng và có quyền lực lớn, thay vào đó tạo ra một thế giới mà tất cả mọi người đều có quyền tự chủ và tự quyết. Tại Bitmark, chúng tôi liên hệ tới các triết lý cốt lõi của blockchain bằng cách nói rằng hệ thống cần có tính mở (để ai cũng có thể truy cập), không giới hạn (để các rào cản trong thế giới thực không ảnh hưởng đến các quyền bình đẳng trong thế giới ảo của chúng tôi), không có sự kiểm duyệt (để không ai có thể ngăn cản sự tham gia của người khác), và không cần cấp phép (để ai cũng có thể đóng góp vào sự đồng thuận). Và điều đó mang chúng tôi quay về với việc so sánh giữa proof of stake và proof of work. Để hệ thống phòng thủ Sybil có thể thực sự phát huy các nguyên tắc ban đầu của công nghệ blockchain, nó cần phải là một hệ thống mà bất kỳ ai cũng có thể tham gia, và hai hệ thống phòng thủ Sybil phổ biến nhất lại tiếp cận vấn đề này không giống nhau. Bitmark có tiếng nói trong cuộc tranh luận này vì chúng tôi đã tạo ra hệ thống blockchain của riêng mình, được gọi là Bitmark Property System. Trong khi hệ thống blockchain của Bitcoin bảo vệ tiền điện tử thì hệ thống blockchain của Bitmark bảo vệ quyền tài sản, cho phép mọi người sở hữu, chuyển nhượng, và tạo ra lợi nhuận từ dữ liệu và các tài sản kỹ thuật số của mình. Trong quá trình xây dựng hệ thống blockchain công khai của Bitmark, chúng tôi đã xem xét rất nhiều câu hỏi về triết lý của blockchain; và sau đó dựa trên những câu trả lời để thiết kế blockchain của chúng tôi. Một trong những quyết định của chúng tôi là sử dụng hệ thống proof of work, và chúng tôi khá ngạc nhiên khi nhiều người thắc mắc rằng vì sao chúng tôi không sử dụng proof of stake. Có một vài lý do, nhưng quan trọng nhất là: Chúng tôi không tin rằng cơ chế proof of stake phù hợp lý tưởng ban đầu của Bitcoin, cũng là lý tưởng chính mà chúng tôi sử dụng để tạo nên hệ thống Bitmark blockchain. Nói ngắn gọn, proof of stake đi ngược lại lý tưởng về sự bình đẳng của blockchain. Có thể chắc chắn rằng, các thợ đào có nhiều quyền lực trong hệ thống blockchain hoạt động theo cơ chế proof of work, nhưng chúng ta đều biết rằng những người này đã mua những giàn khai thác chỉ để đảm bảo tiếng nói của họ trong hệ thống blockchain. Mặc dù họ chỉ hiếm lắm mới tạo được một khối, nhưng họ có thể bảo đảm rằng các giao dịch của họ không bao giờ bị kiểm duyệt. Tất cả mọi người đều có khả năng đó trong hệ thống Bitcoin blockchain (mặc dù với mức giá cao hơn so với thời kỳ đầu, do sự thành công của hệ thống). Ngược lại, proof of stake lại tập trung quyền lực vào tay một vài người — những người cũ và những người giàu — và điều này phản ánh chính xác thực trạng của thế giới thực, điều mà Bitcoin muốn xóa bỏ. Giao thức này ngăn chặn nhiều người tham gia, tạo cơ hội cho người giàu trở nên giàu có hơn, và nó cũng tạo ra những nguy cơ mới từ việc kiểm duyệt. Mặc dù chúng ta đang bàn luận về vấn đề này ở cấp độ cá nhân, tuy nhiên mỗi công ty, tổ chức hay nhà nước có thể cũng nên có chung mối quan ngại: những người mới có thể gặp phải những rào cản vì đối thủ có thể ngăn họ tham gia vào một blockchain hoạt động dựa trên proof of stake. Proof of stake thực sự có khả năng tạo ra chế độ tài phiệt kỹ thuật số, và như vậy, thậm chí chưa cần nói đến đến các mối quan ngại khác thì sự thay đổi trong triết lý đó đã đủ cho chúng tôi có cơ sở để từ bỏ hoàn toàn việc sử dụng cơ chế này (và chúng tôi chắc rằng nhiều người đam mê blockchain khác cũng vậy). Một vấn đề nghiêm trọng khác của proof of stake là hệ thống này chưa được kiểm thử kỹ lưỡng. Chúng tôi tin tưởng vào hệ thống proof of work vì nó đã và đang là xương sống của Bitcoin và Ethereum trong nhiều năm nay; hệ thống này đã xử lý ba phần tư số giao dịch trên hàng tỷ giao dịch. Ngược lại, Peercoin, ngay cả với mức vốn hóa lên tới 10 triệu USD, cũng chỉ thực hiện trung bình được khoảng một tá giao dịch mỗi giờ. Nhìn chung, Peercoin mới chỉ tích lũy được vài triệu giao dịch; và con số này chỉ bằng một phần ngàn so với con số mà Bitcoin và Ethereum đã tích lũy được. Trong khi đó, Ethereum đã bỏ ra hơn 5 năm để nghiên cứu một số cơ chế proof of stake khác. Trong khoảng thời gian đó, vào năm 2016, Vitalik Buterin nói rằng: “Sau nhiều năm nghiên cứu, có một điều đã trở nên rõ ràng: proof of stake không dễ dàng — không dễ dàng đến mức nhiều người coi nó là bất khả thi.” Có thể trong tương lai, một người nào đó sẽ đưa ra được một giao thức proof of stake đã được kiểm thử kỹ lưỡng, kiểm tra toàn diện, đồng thời giải đáp được các vấn đề đang tồn tại của cơ chế proof of stake trong việc củng cố quyền lực. Tuy nhiên không phải ngay bây giờ. Tất cả những điều nêu trên, tuy vậy lại không khẳng định rằng cơ chế proof of work sẽ không gặp trở ngại nào, bởi vì thực tế nó có rất nhiều vấn đề. Chúng ta đều biết rằng việc sử dụng năng lượng luôn là một vấn đề mà nhiều người quan ngại, tuy nhiên chúng tôi không quan ngại về vấn đề này theo hướng như vậy; cũng giống như việc chúng tôi tin rằng mọi người nên được có quyền tự chủ trong thế giới blockchain, chúng tôi nghĩ rằng họ cũng nên có quyền tự chủ đó trong thế giới thật, đồng nghĩa với việc sẽ không có kiểm duyệt hay kiểm soát việc sử dụng năng lượng của họ. Loại quyền tự chủ này đã và đang là yếu tố cốt lõi trong các xã hội tự do: ví dụ như, chúng ta hoàn toàn hiểu được chi phí bảo hộ môi trường cho xe ô tô, cũng như những mối nguy hiểm chúng có thể gây ra cho người cầm lái, các lái xe khác và cho người đi bộ; tuy nhiên, chúng ta hầu như không cố gắng kiểm soát lượng sử dụng ô tô bằng cách hạn chế nó mà chúng ta sẽ giải quyết vấn đề bằng cách làm cho chúng trở nên hiệu quả và an toàn hơn. Cũng giống như vậy, trong một xã hội tự do, chúng ta có thể tìm cách làm cho các sản phẩm năng lượng trở nên thân thiện với môi trường hơn và có thể tái sử dụng được, thay vì việc đặt ra giới hạn cho cách mọi người sử dụng năng lượng. Tuy nhiên, có nhiều thách thức khác cho cơ chế proof of work: ý tưởng về một cuộc tấn công 51% là thứ phải khiến chúng ta thật sự quan ngại. Hơn nữa, là một công ty làm việc với hệ thống blockchain dựa trên cơ chế proof of work, chúng tôi luôn phải tự hỏi rằng liệu còn có chỗ đứng cho một mạng lưới lớn thứ ba hoạt động dựa theo cơ chế proof of work, bên cạnh Bitcoin và Ethereum hay không. Hoặc, liệu rằng sự phổ biến của các mạng lưới sử dụng cơ chế proof of work có làm loãng cơ sở của các thợ đào, làm họ dễ bị lôi kéo tham gia vào nhóm những thợ đào có thể nhảy từ blockchain này sang blockchain khác và tham gia vào các cuộc tấn công 51%? Hiện tại, chúng tôi lựa chọn tuân theo các giải pháp phổ biến hơn và được kiểm thử kỹ lưỡng hơn, tuy nhiên chúng ta cũng nên nhận thức được những nguy hiểm tồn tại trong bất kỳ giải pháp kiểm soát Sybil nào trong một hệ thống không cần cấp phép. Một cách công bằng, Bitmark nhận thấy các ưu điểm của cơ chế proof of work hiện nay vẫn đang chiếm ưu thế so với cơ chế proof of stake. Tuy nhiên chúng tôi quan tâm hơn tới vấn đề nền tảng triết lý: chúng tôi cần nhìn thấy một cơ chế proof of stake được liên kết chặt chẽ hơn với những lý tưởng ban đầu của hệ thống blockchain để chúng tôi có thể chấp nhận nó, kể cả khi nó đã được kiểm thử kỹ lưỡng và mang những cải tiến so với hệ thống proof of work chúng tôi đang sử dụng hiện tại. Chắc chắn, chúng tôi hiểu rằng sẽ có các nhóm khác có thể cân bằng những ưu nhược điểm của hai cơ chế phòng thủ Sybil này theo các cách khác nhau. Nhưng cuối cùng, chúng tôi tin rằng rồi chúng ta cũng sẽ phải quay lại giải quyết câu hỏi triết lý đó: với tư cách là những người sáng lập nên blockchain, liệu bạn có quan tâm đến việc trao quyền cho mọi người hay không? Hay, triết lý cá nhân của bạn khác với điều này? Chúng tôi tin các triết lý là quan trọng, và chúng tôi hy vọng sẽ tiếp tục đề cập đến chủ đề này trong các bài viết tiếp theo về những lựa chọn trong việc thiết kế blockchain. Các chủ đề trong tương lai chúng tôi đang xem xét bao gồm các hệ thống tập trung ẩn, phép lồng token và các ngôn ngữ kịch bản (scripting language), xuất bản thông tin, và trao đổi về việc liệu bạn có nên chỉ sử dụng blockchain Bitcoin (hay không sử dụng bất kỳ blockchain nào).

Although not widely known to the public, Quantum Signal helped the military develop software that allowed it to remotely control robotic vehicles from thousands of miles away. It even built a robust simulation environment capable of testing autonomous vehicle designs that’s still in use today. While Quantum Signal has operated in relative obscurity over the past couple of decades, its work has been on our radar at Ford for a while now. Over the past few years, Ford has been assembling a team of uniquely qualified experts in software development, simulation and machine learning from all around the world as it accelerates autonomous vehicle development — and we’re proud to announce the squad is getting even bigger and more formidable. To further advance its goal of launching a self-driving vehicle business, Ford has acquired Quantum Signal and will make use of its extensive experience in real-time simulation and algorithm development to develop its Transportation as a Service (TaaS) platform, as well as vehicle controls that support the customer experience, functional safety and other vehicle systems. The wide range of the group’s work portfolio means it will be able to support Ford in numerous areas as the company develops self-driving vehicles and transportation as a service business, including software development and hardware prototyping. medium.com Quantum Signal is renowned for its ANVEL modeling and simulation environment, which has been used by military robotics programs to explore the performance of unmanned remote and autonomous systems. With the company’s expertise, we can develop even more comprehensive simulation environments at Ford in which we can test our vehicles and our business model in order to achieve further performance improvements. Beyond simulation, Quantum Signal has done extensive work for the military in developing algorithms that help guide autonomous vehicles. Outside the software world, the company is well-versed in robotics as well as sensing and perception systems. All of this work can be repurposed to support Ford’s self-driving vehicles to help improve their ability to analyze the environment around them. Operating out of a former school building in Saline, Quantum Signal has cultivated its own unique culture that we want to preserve as the team joins Ford and grows in the future. This is something we’re confident we can do because we’ve done it before — and we’re currently doing it again with a machine learning company that joined Ford almost three years ago: SAIPS. Based in Israel, SAIPS is working closely with both Ford and the team at Argo AI, using machine learning to create an innovative visual cognition system for self-driving cars that can detect vehicles or pedestrians in the surrounding environment — including their blinking turn signals and hazard lights — even under severe weather and lighting conditions. Another core system enables fully automated, high-resolution 3D mapping of urban environments, something that plays a crucial role in allowing self-driving vehicles to situate themselves in the real world. This important work has fueled the deliberate and thoughtful growth of the company. Since joining Ford, SAIPS has more than doubled its size to approximately 30 people and moved into new headquarters in Tel Aviv. Most recently, SAIPS welcomed aboard some of the world’s leading researchers in a field called reinforcement learning, which could foster learning and decision-making in self-driving vehicles with less human supervision. Just like SAIPS, Quantum Signal will play a crucial role in advancing Ford’s self-driving vehicle development while also representing the company’s commitment to nurturing the talent needed to successfully deploy this technology. When Quantum Signal CEO Mitchell Rohde told his team they were joining Ford, he recounted growing up in Michigan as a young boy, watching his father get an antique Model T back in working order, and hearing dad lecture him about Henry Ford’s contribution to the world. If Mitch was going to become an engineer, his father said, this was the kind of lasting contribution he should try to make, too. All engineers want to do meaningful work that makes a difference, not sit on a shelf, Rohde told his team. Now, they are going to get the chance to directly influence the world, much in the way that Ford did. Just like when Ford brought the freedom of mobility to the masses through the Model T, the opportunity to expand that freedom even more is here now. We can’t wait to make it a reality. -- -- Our Self-Driving Future Our mission is to deliver great products and make the world a better place.

Luckily, Bassma Ali and Rasha Abu-Safiah have never been afraid of the impossible. The pair have worked their way up to becoming international leaders, co-running an enterprise to create jobs, hope, and peace all over the world. “We were challenged to find the balance between the family and work, to avoid toxic people, negativity and to fight our fears.” -Bassma Ali and Rasha Abu-Safiah Despite cultural, political and economic tensions in their home country, Bassma and Rasha say they have been able to find the balance between being mothers, founders, and entrepreneurs. Bassma is especially successful in designing projects and turning proposals into reality, while Rasha brings to the table her skills in talent management and social responsibility. “I am passionate about businesses, and business modelling for social enterprises and their social impact. I believe right business models can create opportunities from gaps, and improve community overall.” -Bassma Ali Bassma and Rasha first worked together as initiative leaders in the United Nations for Relief and Work Agency (UNRWA) where they led high impact projects centring around the diffusion of information and communication (ICT) technology. The projects included poverty survey automation, which improved data collection and analysis in order to provide better and more efficient service to the poorest neighbourhoods and procedures for urban planning process using ICT tools and better data management to increase downward accountability to the community. “We have lead both training and related projects that resulted in unifying and computerizing essential shelter data for displaced population after the conflicts. The initiative has made information concerning shelter provisions and replacements more reliable and transparent for displaced families.” -Bassma Ali and Rasha Abu-Safiah The success of these initiatives enabled Bassma and Rasha to establish GGateway, a social enterprise that helps youth in Gaza to deliver IT services to the world since Gaza is sieged and Information Technology is borderless industry. Many IT students in Gaza have trouble finding jobs after graduation. In fact, nearly 50% of the working-age people in Gaza are unemployed. The problem is more chronic among women, 92% of IT Females in Gaza are unemployed. This is a particularly hopeless statistic because of the land, air and sea blockades surrounding the country. Work is scarce for the booming population living within a confined space. GGateway creates an end to end solution by connecting talented young people with international employers and jobs that can be performed remotely. “GGateway aims to reduce the high unemployment rate among IT graduates in Gaza by mobilizing donor funds and business revenue to establish a learning workplace. Graduates leave the enterprise after approximately 12 months of training and work experience as qualified Project Associates with employable CV’s.” — GGateway website In building this program, Bassma and Rasha are dedicated to helping ambitious women like themselves. In an effort to promote equality, they reserve space so that at least half of GGateway’s participants can be women. The program has been a huge success — with over 800 graduates trained. In 2018 Bassma and Rasha were featured in Time Magazine’s “Next Generation Leaders”. As GGateway continues to grow, the women are looking forward to exploring a new terrain for their entrepreneurial spirits: Aotearoa. “Besides exploring New Zealand culture and settling down. We are planning to better define our business and ensure its visibility based on stakeholder and community groups.” -Bassma Ali and Rasha Abu-Safiah They say they are looking forward to being introduced to the ecosystem, making business connections, working on projects as a team, and receiving advice and encouragement from their peers in the Edmund Hillary Fellowship.

However, we previously tried to launch in Glasgow but our product wasn’t suitable. When learner drivers would search for driving instructors in Dundee — every instructor on the platform would be able to take that student. This was not the case in Glasgow. Greater Glasgow has a population of over 1 million people. There are six driving test centres opposed to the one in in Dundee and two in Aberdeen. Previously we had opted to have location searching to work based on the location name, rather than postcode search. This was quicker for us to implement originally and it is how we launched in Aberdeen and Dundee but moving into larger locations such as Glasgow, Manchester and London we knew we needed to move to a postcode system. We trialled this by building a specific landing page for Glasgow. We designed the new flow, user tested it with instructors and with learner drivers and one week later — we were live. The flow took anyone one finding Glasgow search results from Google to a new GoRoadie Glasgow landing page that prioritised the learner driver drilling down by postcode. At this point, learner drivers would then only see instructors that served their area. Now the technical details! Shockingly, this change took less than half a day. Since GoRoadie is built on a Rails stack, we added a gem called “Geocoder” and that allowed us to simply filter instructors on their postcode and a radius. We needed to add longitude and latitude fields to the instructors — and we now set this when instructors sign up after they enter their postcode. And with that, we can now serve Glasgow. Interestingly we can now serve Birmingham and London too. 😎 GoRoadie is a UK-based startup, connecting driving students with their ideal instructors. We just launched our brand new Aberdeen Driving Lessons landing page, helping Aberdonians pick their ideal driving instructor. -- -- Co-founder at GoRoadie. Software. Business. Strategy.

In 2017, when Keith Porcaro and I first taught our Georgetown Law students about risk assessments, our lesson summarized those debates in a lecture and discussion. Afterwards, we worried that students were taking away a simple, wrong lesson: if a software tool is sufficiently “accurate”, it will solve the problem presented and it does not require further investigation. The discussion shouldn’t end there. Software has framing power: the mere presence of a risk assessment tool can reframe a judge’s decision-making process and induce new biases, regardless of the tool’s quality. This past fall, we wanted our students to engage with this broader, ecosystem-level issue, and to understand the far-reaching consequences that pretrial detention can have on defendants. This reflects the overall goals of our practicum class, Criminal Justice Technology, Policy, and Law. We want our students to not just be familiar with technology, but be able to think critically about how software and data-driven tools can influence legal ecosystems — sometimes in unexpected ways. After all, law students aren’t training to be programmers or data scientists: they’re training to be advocates. Legal education needs to equip law students to analyze novel technologies in context, and build arguments for or against them. So, we built a simulation. We call it Detain/Release. Detain/Release puts students in the role of a county judge at a bail hearing, and prompts them to detain or release individual defendants pending trial. In the simulation, students are served cases that look like this: Included with a distorted picture of the defendant is his or her biographical and charge details, a prosecutor’s recommendation, a defendant’s statement, and a risk assessment. The risk assessment provides a low/medium/high likelihood that a defendant will fail to appear, commit a crime, or commit a violent crime. Under the hood, it uses U.S. Census and Bureau of Justice Statistics data to generate defendants and alleged offenses. The simulation can generate millions of unique defendants. We added additional mechanics to make the world of the simulation more complete. Detained defendants are placed in a county jail with limited capacity and stay there for a period of time, depending on their charge. Released defendants may commit a violation or new crime while on release, which appears in the form of a (sometimes histrionic) local newspaper article: These two mechanics simulate outside policy pressures. To visualize this, we include two meters: jail occupancy, which increases with detentions, and public fear, which increases with violations. If either reaches its full capacity (indicated as a bar at the top of the user interface) the simulation ends. These meters are optional; the simulation can run with or without them. To facilitate the use of Detain/Release in the classroom, we built a teacher-facing “remote control” to configure runs of the simulation with different options, and generate a virtual “classroom” for students to join. We also built a real-time dashboard, which we projected onto the wall. While students were using the simulation, we presented a simple live view, showing each participant’s progress during the current run. The dashboard also included a statistical view, which breaks down the actions of all participants in the classroom: how often are defendants detained? How influential is a risk assessment or a defendant’s story? Finally, we included a line-up of faces: defendants that students detained and released. Our lesson interspersed runs of the simulation with short lectures about risk assessment tools and class discussions about the students’ decision-making process. Our mini-lectures covered the basics of bail, the mechanics and implementation of risk assessments, and legal and technical challenges to their use in pretrial. We wanted students to put themselves in the role of a judge, and think about how they would make pretrial detention decisions. We began with a tutorial run that students completed on their own: ten defendants, no risk assessments. After that, we divided students into groups and had them do three full runs of the simulation. We wanted students to talk about how they made their decisions, during and after the simulation runs. By the third run, we found that students are invested in the simulation and in the detention and release decisions they’ve made. Throughout, we were deliberately opaque about how the simulation worked — about how accurate the risk assessments actually were, and about what probabilities “low”, “medium”, and “high” corresponded to. For the most part, no one asked, either in our classroom or during our tests of the simulation. Despite that, as they progressed through the lesson, students began to feel more confident and assured in their detention and release decisions. They built interpretive systems to quickly make decisions from the information they had been given. Some of their rules and systems were expected: high violence usually meant detention. Others, less so: after seeing two female defendants fail to appear, one team began detaining women by default. After the third and final run, we showed students the consequences of their decisions, with one last dashboard view: How did pretrial detention decisions affect defendant outcomes? This reveal takes the air out of the room. It drives home the framing power of the risk assessment tool we had presented them: students relied on it, deeply, despite receiving no promises about its accuracy, and “corrected” for it in random ways. This had consequences. For their part, our students responded positively to the simulation, and recommended we use it again in future classes. We wanted our lesson to demystify algorithmic tools for students, and build a foundational understanding of how these tools work, how they’re applied in practice, and whether those applications are appropriate. But most of all, we wanted students to reconsider risk assessments, not as tools for predicting the future, but as tools that can rewrite a defendant’s future long after their case has ended. We’re excited about Detain/Release, and plan to keep improving on it. As we do, we’re hoping to engage with legal communities around the country. To help us improve Detain/Release, we’re planning a limited release of this simulation to other professors and trainers, along with the additional classroom features. We’re exploring how Detain/Release might be deployed as a research tool in addition to a teaching tool. Our dashboard can provide deep insight into how people react to the simulation under different parameters. Similarly, there are real world applications that could leverage this tool to help train stakeholders adopting or contemplating a pretrial risk assessment. If you’re interested in using Detain/Release for teaching, training, or research, and are willing to provide feedback, please reach out. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*a2w1U4qFocP44O65.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*a2w1U4qFocP44O65.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*a2w1U4qFocP44O65.jpg"

Denis stated that you can always include your client data as goodwill on a balance sheet, which has a positive effect on the valuation of a company. I stated that client data can only be included on the balance sheet when a transaction takes place — so buying or selling a company. Ultimately, we agreed that this part of the goodwill should be included on a balance sheet if you can demonstrably use client data to generate additional revenue”, states my former colleague Pim van Berkel. Pim teaches at the Nyenrode New Business School in Amsterdam and was director of Fanalists, which provides a data-driven method which assists companies increase their value by making smarter use of data. He worked with client data on a daily basis in order to increase their sales, get their data in order and therefore increase in value. First, let’s take a step back. What is the value of a company? What is goodwill and how does goodwill contribute to the company valuation? Traditional bankers look at the assets that are on the balance sheet of a company. The value of these assets is, according to the traditional bankers, a guarantee to issue a loan with the same value. If a company faces problems, then all assets are sold. The company uses this to repay the loan to the bank. A traditional perspective of the classic financing on the basis of balance sheet value can be seen below. From a visual perspective, there is a ratio, which is called ‘Loan to value’. This ratio is 75% in this example. In other words, the issued loan of 750,000 euro is issued on the basis of 75% of the total value of all possessions (that are worth 1 million in total). This banking method is not perfect. If the value of the possessions drops (due to the economy or market conditions), there is a serious risk that loans are not fully covered by the value of the possessions. With decreasing sales and profits, the amount of cash in stock will also drop and quickly the threat of a liquidity shortage exists. Another valuation method of companies is to add up all future cash flows, converted into cash value. This is how to provide a valuation of the digital client base. The long-term value of a digital ecosystem is primarily determined by the value of the client relationships: relationships between the client and the company, between mutual fans and clients. The existing and future relationships primarily determine the future revenues (also called cash flow). These future cash flows are converted into cash value at a yield requirement. This is how the so-called client capital exists. In other words; a form of goodwill, the digital assets, can be placed on the balance sheet as soon as the company is acquired. The determination of the future cash flows is a complicated matter, in view of the fact that clients have a varying lifespan. Not only due to their age, but also because of the different lifespans of clients– which is partly determined by the level of interest in the product or service that a company offers. That is why it is recommended to divide groups of fans or clients into different cohorts within the future periods when determining the company valuation. It is assumed that with time, the cohorts will become larger. Below you can find an example of such cohorts, which have been converted into cash value in the formula by dividing them by the yield requirement. The new valuation method also requires another approach. Much more than previously, data collections and data mutations will be looked at from various systems and applications that are linked together. Auditors will get the chance to show their skills more than ever before. Data validation and the data traffic over the internal and external digital motorways will have to be assessed. It is, and remains, important whether a direct ‘cash flow’ or advantage comes from the digital strategy. The roadmap below is a suggestion and fundamentally resembles the steps that need to be taken within data analyses. However, these steps are done once the desired information is extracted. To actually be able to calculate a return from social media, this would have to be looked at further. Data becomes richer information following analysis. This information translates itself into a cash flow with new revenue models, when a new public is reached or when new product-market combinations are possible. This is the roadmap for a positive financial result of a digital strategy: It should be clear that with online marketing via the internet ecosystem cash flows can be measured more than with offline marketing (e.g. a direct mailing). Moreover, the reach can increase even more because fans wish to share their social lives with each other. Not only the first users and fans are reached, but also their friends and their networks. This considerable expands the market potential. Also, thanks to the presence of the current software, marketing is far more transparent and measurable than previously thanks to advanced measuring instruments and models. The current methods and techniques of (integral) company valuations must be examined. Historical figures and results from the past give increasingly less guarantees for the future. With this knowledge in mind, how can you increase your company value as much as possible? Pim van Berkel and I quickly created approximately 30 product or service categories for this. With these product categories, companies, brands or festivals increase their sales using data. With the Fanalists company Van Berkel offers companies data insights where they can develop or sell related products. The good news: developing and optimising new revenue models are bearing fruit. The Armin van Buuren case, which is looked at in detail in a later chapter, is a clear example of the optimisation of data-driven sales that Fanalists was involved with. Van Berkel: “It is more than just selling tickets. Consider also selling clothes, watches, perfume, magazines or subscriptions to Spotify or own music channels. If a festival organisation has its data in order, the collaboration with other companies or the development of own products can be much more focussed. Maybe the visitors of your festivals prefer Adidas shoes over those from Nike. Then Nike can opt for targeted advertising at your festival or social media channels.” Van Berkel believes it all starts with a simple principle: companies must do more than only sending. “Consider the popular TV programme The Voice; a TV programme that is busy sending and broadcasting. However, they do not always consider the perception of the recipient. Delve into the preferences of the target group, then you will be able to search for a sponsor for the programme in a much more focussed way. If you wish to discover new sales opportunities, start with getting to know your target group. This image shows what Van Berkel means. This is the first sketch which he has made based on my story. Data flows from the social media channels of The Voice. This illustrates what the target group looks like. “This makes it possible to set up collaborations that pay off for the advertiser and the TV programme. Making it possible to not only sell the license to (foreign) TV channels, but to also sell on the collaborations. This increases the value of the license for The Voice. In other words: this increases the Brand Equity (the brand value), the valuation and therefore the digital assets of The Voice.” The fact that a company, brand or festival can generate more sales or can achieve a higher company valuation thanks to proceeding with data in a smart way, is good news. But, let´s be honest, not yet very specific. What is a Facebook Like actually worth? “For this, we have made rather rough assumptions where it becomes possible to determine the value of a fan. The value of a fan also depends on the business model of your company: if you sell subscriptions, then a client is quickly worth more — and therefore a potential client (or fan) too.” “Above all, it concerns two other issues: is future revenue likely and have you made sufficient efforts to get to work with the data insights? “Consider for instance Strandfestival Zand, where many parents take their children: one would have to approach that differently to a hardcore dance festival. Data only pays off if used effectively. Data is not worth anything in itself. The beauty of data is that the sales department can be better served and run on the basis of the data analysis you have completed. If you do not approach those banks or insurers with the data insights in your hand, then your company valuation will not increase.” It makes sense that festivals are looking for a way to utilise smarter forms of marketing: there are increasingly more festivals. “With many festivals booking a major name such as Armin van Buuren, Hardwell or Afrojack. Therefore, that no longer makes your festival unique. So, how will you do it differently? By dropping the price, as often happens. That is the full extent of the creativity, unfortunately. It is relevant for new festivals in particular — a festival like Lowlands often sells out anyway — that still have to stand out. Financially it is not going well with many festival organisations, if you look at the Chamber of Commerce figures. Van Berkel’s solution? “I would nurture an established relationship with a fan or client and maintain the relationship. There is often a cycle: a few months before the festival there is a great deal of communication, something is communicated during the festival, then soon after — but after that it goes completely quiet. While there is certainly enough to be shared. Naturally, you can tell what music was being played, the branded festival clothing that can be purchased, but why not organise a mini reunion? For example, organise an (online) brainstorm session, together with your fans. Ask them: what could be better next year? What else would you like? In this way your festival will keep distinguishing itself.” Van Berkel concludes: “In short: you will never discover new destinations if you do not leave the port.” >>> Go to the next chapter -- -- In order to get started with digital change, it is important to realize that this change consists of three fundamental core elements.

Because of the world we live in (i.e. the internet era), there’s a plethora of meanings you can choose to attribute to these two words together. The worst case scenario is you pick the least available meaning to you, so that you can brush it off inside your head and say “That’s why I wouldn’t do it”. Say if you’re a SaaS company that deals with people from the finance industry, indeed, maybe they’re not very likely to spend time on Instagram stories. So maybe if you match “community building” with what your kids/children have shown you that brands do on Instagram i.e. making polls/quizzes and imagine for a second that community building means doing THAT with your kind of customers, then yes, you can brush it off fast and say “I wouldn’t do that for my users”. But again, these two words have a lot of possible executions. I’ve written before about the leanest and quickest way to start doing this as a CEO: answering whatever comment/tweet/etc. mentions your company name. chagency.co.uk In another article, I took it a step further and analysed another thing that is within hand’s reach of a CEO: building a community with the paying users of your product. Networking, if you want, on steroids. chagency.co.uk My point with today’s written piece is to show how it can take different shapes and forms. From email communities to Facebook groups. Crypto people are centered around Telegram groups. Visually organized content (like recipes) are centered around Pinterest’s boards. Once you have a look at where your people spend time, you’re one step closer to building a community with them. What do you get out of it? True fans. And more often than not, friends as well.

It did so by placing two pieces of text next to one another, one in which reCAPTCHA knew how to read, and another in which it didn’t. The odds were that if you, the human, correctly typed in the characters it knew, then you would also type, correctly, the characters it didn’t know². We are helping the modern-day reCAPTCH train image recognition api’s³ (which I find to be extremely annoying) by identifying which objects are crosswalks, cars, buses or anything else, and we are, for sure, allowing Google another way to track us⁴.

It is believed that the total amount of food produced is more than enough to feed the world. Despite this, about 821 million people suffer hunger due to 40% loss to pests, diseases, environmental and post-harvest conditions. It is therefore important to provide innovative and reliable solutions against such losses that affect agricultural products. As a result of this, it is germane to have quick access to monitoring and control via modern technology. With the help of scientists and researchers, advancements are being made to deliver precision to agriculture at your fingertips. The use of sophisticated technologies such as robots, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial images, and GPS Technology drive this.

Our family and friends deserve our attention, our connection, and our love. As a part of my series about “Bleeding edge” technological breakthroughs that seem copied from science fiction, I had the pleasure of interviewing CEO and Co-founder of OPKIX, Lawrence “LG” Greaves. Splitting his formative years between London and Johannesburg, OPKIX Co-Founder and C.E.O. Lawrence “LG” Greaves first made his mark on the business world upon settling in Southern California during 2005. He planted roots in Orange County at the age of 22 and started a consulting firm that would be acquired by a national firm. Elected to the company’s leadership team, he stood out as the youngest leader in the firm’s history. 2008 saw him co-found ETONIEN at 25-years-old. The financial consulting practice specialized in assisting pre-IPO companies with accounting, planning, budgeting, and forecasting, while also serving private equity firms and Fortune 500 companies by restructuring management. ETONIEN blossomed into a respected national firm that hired over 800 employees since its inception with offices all over the U.S. As ETONIEN achieved success, his entrepreneurial spirit drove him to become a board advisor and shareholder for various businesses as well as an active venture investor whose portfolio encompasses technology, hardware, real estate, bio-technology, and more. Adept at augmenting revenue growth, marketing, capital formation, and fundraising, he started as one of the first three investors and assumed the role of C.E.O. for OPKIX in 2016, raising a seed round of $675K at $10 million valuation as well as a Series A of $5.4 million at an $88.5 million pre-money valuation. Thank you so much for doing this with us! Can you tell us a story about what brought you to this specific career path? After reviewing the initial brand concept, I originally found my way to OPKIX as a potential investor. I immediately connected with the team and eventually offered to not only invest financially, but to invest my years of team building, leadership, management, and board experience in the form of being the company’s CEO and Co-Founder. From the outset, we always saw the device as more than a camera. Our goal was to build a community of creators, and we’ve collectively fashioned the foundation for such a community to flourish. Can you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career with OPKIX? A year after I became involved in OPKIX, we had identified a clear strategy, raised $6 million dollars, and had just started the design and engineering services to build the world’s smallest, smartest, wearable cameras and video editing app. In doing so, we met with industry leaders in the imaging space. These leaders all told us the size, quality, and functionality we demanded from this camera were impossible. I left that day and immediately booked an in-person session with our lead engineer, Dr. Lane Brooks (undergrad, Masters and PhD in electrical engineering from MIT as well as “Guinness World Record” holder for the world’s smallest camera design, at that time). I remember flying to his Utah base. I rented a $40 private room — at a public library of all places — and we sat in front of a white board for hours listening to him explain why it was impossible. We ultimately found a workaround, which has now become the underlying IP (pending) for our first-generation wireless camera systems: the OPKIX ONE. We simply wouldn’t take, “No,” for an answer. The moment of finding the workaround has been the most emotionally dynamic and interesting development. It really solidified our brand trajectory. Can you tell us about the “Bleeding edge” technological breakthroughs that you are working on? How do you think that will help people? As we are a hardware, software, and social sharing company, we’re looking to leverage the next phase of artificial intelligence to enhance the user experience of photo and video sharing. We’re working extensively on the educational aspects of our current and future releases throughout each level of the Opkix ecosystem. We are undergoing training for human learning through artificial intelligence as well as personal and professional communication mediums on the B2B side. We have some previously filed patents that are non-consumer focused. These patents have some major runway with regard to the intelligence community. It will use the best of the discrete form factors we are able to achieve and further enhance the use case through the value of real-time sharing and intelligent interpretation of video-based content. How do you think this might change the world? It already has! Billions of videos are created around the world, and they are no longer 30-minute camcorder videos of our children’s recitals. They are short, real-time videos intended to document our lives. Video is the new keyboard. Our opportunity is to support the use of a smartphone, but enable and empower you to put the smartphone down. By putting it down, you can be present in the moments you want to capture with our sleek, lifestyle-focused mounts that can record at the speed of now. Existing players in the tech community are evaluating their next big moves in the evolution of the smartphone. It used to be a one-stop technology solution that could do multiple things. Manufacturers are now breaking down the functionality of a smartphone into multiple wearable components that communicate with each other harmoniously, yet more logically assimilate to the natural ergonomics of the human body. A wearable camera is the logical next step in the seamless integration of technology into daily life. Frankly, it’s a blue-sky opportunity for OPKIX. Keeping “Black Mirror” in mind can you see any potential drawbacks about this technology that people should think more deeply about? The drawbacks fictionalized in modern media with regard to the security and privacy concerns of a discreet, wearable, camera are not OPKIX-specific; they’re mostly “what if’s”. Our constant desire to document every moment of our lives and, reciprocally, to watch others do the same thing, along with the contradictory demand for privacy, is an oxymoron already playing out in society. We implicitly agree to share our content with the social media sites that house it and makers of hardware and software that we use to create it. It’s not a new trend. Our hardware is actually built with security in mind for the consumer. In fact, we went to great lengths to design a “light-pipe,” or the square halo light on the front of our camera that illuminates when recording. Therefore, the light notifies people they are being recorded. This is an additional privacy step that we developed to address such concerns as the ones sensationalized by content creators and sci-fi. As such, we pride ourselves on being responsible technology evangelists. We are constructing hardware and software to support the concept of being in the moment without violating another’s privacy. We want you to share what you want, where and when you want, so we have these extra measures in place in order to provide security, ensure privacy, and enable use of your preferred social media platforms. Was there a “tipping point” that led you to this breakthrough? Can you tell us that story? All credit for the initial concept goes to my business partner, Shahin Armirpour. Shahin is an avid snowboarder. While snowboarding during 2016 in ultra low temperatures, his wearable camera not only died in the cold, but took forever to transfer video files…Not to mention, it wasn’t aesthetically designed, either. Our breakthrough was the realization we’re not competing with this category of device, but rather we’re creating a device that addresses the needs of a modern-day consumer. OPKIX is building a new realm rather than occupying a pre-existing realm. What do you need to lead this technology to widespread adoption? Our goal is to allow the average person to capture and share great content. This capability shouldn’t be limited to someone who can only afford the latest and greatest inventions. We need our brand to be accessible and relatable. This generation deserves quality entertainment, authentic memory making, and more importantly, to experience the feeling of being the director and producer of one’s own life story. Personally, I can’t wait to see the creativity to ensue. We’re on the cusp of a new wave of content. We’ll be with its talented architects every step of the way. What have you been doing to publicize this idea? Have you been using any innovative marketing strategies? We work alongside a world-class PR firm who continues to go above and beyond as our brand storyteller and marketplace conduit. We have the support of our investors who have built various billion-dollar companies responsible for numerous everyday innovations. We have also built out a team of 64 global ambassadors who are creators in their own right, lending their stories to our brand. The need for what we created was palpable, but we needed to design and commercialize it to make individuals realize what they had been missing in the marketplace before our launch. Our marketing is organic. We’re putting our products in the hands of talented individuals and accelerating the virality of awesome, original and authentic content to re-inspire a generation and breathe life into our cultural perspective on social media. None of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that? This person is my wife — who was my second girlfriend ever — who I then married at an early age. She has not only been with me on this journey, but she is the captain of the ship. She inspires me to strive for greatness and to achieve the impossible. She reminds me to be humble or get humbled. She is able to reign in a guy who is otherwise unmanageable in a traditional sense. I owe everything to my wife and our two children. How have you used your success to bring goodness to the world? I often donate to at-risk women and children. This includes supporting the build of one of the largest projects of its kind in downtown Los Angeles: St. Anne’s permanent affordable housing site. I started donating to this charity when I first had the resources to do so eleven years ago and was also on their board of trustees and directors for many years. I plan on continuing to fund charitable foundations to support women and children, as I believe they are the key to our collective bright futures. If we can provide the resource of a safe and nurturing environment for children and the mothers who raise them, I promise you this world will be a better place. What are your “5 Things I Wish Someone Told Me Before I Started” and why. (Please share a story or example for each.) 1. Building a billion dollar brand is no cake walk. While running my last company Etonien, I had a front row seat to the IPO of numerous billion dollar companies. Being nimble was the key to the success of each. Problems invariably arise from all angles. Reacting is just as important as acting. In launching a mainstream brand, you have to be prepared for anything, but you have to be even more prepared to roll with the punches. 2. Be more afraid of success than of failure. Success presents a myriad of responsibilities. That’s an honor. If you’re aware of those challenges and willing to learn, you’re more likely to maintain success. The first time I became a C.E.O., I was overwhelmed by the responsibility. Everyone is looking at you. They’re relying on you. It’s a privilege not to be taken lightly. Hold on to a healthy amount of fear. You’ll look out for yourself and those around you better. 3. Be humble, or get humbled. This one I have to credit to my wife. She keeps me humble every day, and it’s a key to success. 4. Your biggest nemesis is often yourself; get out of your own way. It’s easy to get in your own way. I’ve done it throughout my career. I’m proud to admit it, because I walked away with some very valuable lessons. I didn’t repeat those same mistakes. 5. Shut up and listen more. If you’re talking, you’re not listening. I rely on the wisdom of those around me and many mentors I’ve been blessed to call friends over the years. That will never change. You are a person of great influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-) Capture the moments you live in, and live in the moments you capture. Our family and friends deserve our attention, our connection, and our love. Can you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life? “If you never give up, you WILL succeed” — Chris Cyprus. When I moved to America in 2005 with $400 and no college degree, my wife asked me what I would do to contribute to our combined success. I told her I would do whatever it takes. I actually joked that I would proudly clean toilets and, within three years, I would own the largest toilet cleaning business in America (but fully meant it, if that’s what I needed to do!). I am a highly optimistic realist who has learned more from the things I have done wrong than from the things that went right. I think we can all relate to that regardless of our own personal stories. Some very well known VCs read this column. If you had 60 seconds to make a pitch to a VC, what would you say?

https://medium.com/@taykcrane/hitting-reset-on-retros-79a4f82f34e6?source=tag_archive---------22-----------------------,Hitting Reset on Retros,"How to build a more effective, more close-knit team in 30 minutes a week.",Taylor Crane,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Taylor Crane Follow -- Listen Share Before you begin reading, do me two favors: Ready, set, reset. A retro is a recurring meeting with your team at work with a singular purpose: to look backwards in order to move forwards more effectively. We look backwards, first, by celebrating our work together as a team. We then have a candid discussion about how the team is doing, both our accomplishments and our challenges. From this discussion, We become more effective by understanding what isn’t going well, and then immediately working to improve it. We repeat this process every meeting. For my team at Hello Alfred, that means every single week. It may sound fluffy ☁️ at first, but hear me out. It’s easy to participate in a bad retro. A bad retro will feel like nothing is actually getting addressed, those in the room don’t want to be there, or the team is just going through the motions to check a box… 🤷‍️. If this sounds like your experience, I get it. Been there too. It’s also easy to participate in a good retro, you just have to know how to do it, and surprisingly few teams do. I’m going to change that right now. Good retros do exist, they are incredibly valuable, and there are objectively good reasons why your team should start building the habit now. A good, regularly scheduled retro has three basic steps: When those three steps are taken, a good, regularly scheduled retro has three clear outcomes: When done well, a retro is simple, it’s effective, and it becomes a forcing function for the team’s continuous improvement. So we have our team, we’re all in a room together (or video call), we have our celebratory drinks (or non-alcoholic equivalent), and we’re all tired from a week of hard work. Perfect. Let’s start! First, we go around the room in a circle, and give each other a chance to share our Kudos & Concerns. “Kudos”Kudos are shout-outs to team members for doing something positive. Kudos are an opportunity to recognize individuals for their great work, to remember that we’re all in this together, and let the positivity shine! “Kudos to Maddy for the killer presentation you gave to the company. Everyone loved it.” “Kudos to Kyle for taking the initiative to create a customer feedback form for the website. Excited to see the results.” “Concerns”Concerns are issues for our team to discuss and improve upon. Concerns are how our team identifies what’s not working, the issues that would otherwise go unaddressed, or the problems preventing us from succeeding. “I’m concerned we’re not getting enough customer feedback before we launch. How do we know if they’ll like it?” “There’s a bug in our software that customers are complaining about, and we don’t know the root cause.” There are no invalid concerns. Let’s look at two other examples: “I don’t feel like my team understands how much work I put into my designs when they give me critical feedback.” “There aren’t enough healthy snacks in the office.” Obviously one is more serious, but both are valid problems that our team wants to improve on. (I didn’t make either of these up, and I’ll always remember the very raw discussion that came after the first one. Huge turning point for our team at the time.) We write down each concern as it gets expressed. Don’t discuss them yet! Just succinctly record the concern and who raised it. Wait until everyone’s spoken. Think of this as “agenda-building.” Once everybody has had a chance to share, we review the concerns and dive into each in more detail. Why is this a concern? Do others feel the same way? How can it be resolved? Talk about the concern briefly, but recognize that the goal is not to resolve the concern in the meeting, since most are not that simple. Once you’ve talked briefly about a concern, try to identify a next step and an owner who can be responsible for resolving the concern. This helps to get the concern resolved more quickly. Accountability is powerful. “Dylan to organize a group of friend-and-family beta testers before launch.” “Steph to collect more information from our customer success team about the software bug being reported.” We save every un-resolved concern from the retro, and then review them again during the next retro, along with any new ones. This becomes the list of “open concerns.” Each retro, check in on the list of open concerns. Was it resolved? Congrats! Remove it. If not, keep it open and try again next time. The size of the open concerns list will ebb and flow, and our team will get that dopamine hit when a concern is resolved, especially a longstanding concern. Retro over, enjoy the weekend! Make sure the owners of concerns know they have some homework before the next retro. This is best done in writing. You can perhaps tell that this meeting is important to me. I’ve hosted or participated in retros every week since 2011. I’ve seen the difference it makes with all the teams I’ve been a part of. Beyond a shadow of a doubt it brings the team closer together, and makes us more effective. I’m on a mission to convince every team at every company in every industry that retros can have a hugely positive effect on output and longevity. And I’ve done more than just write this blog post. I built an app called Outro, over many nights and weekends, dedicated to running a productive retro like I describe above. It’s a playful, simple tool that’s meant to support the discussion but otherwise get out of the way. You can read more about the Outro story here, including the benefit of using Outro with your team. If you want to host a team retro for the first time (or the n-th time), if you like the sound of Kudos & Concerns, or if you think your team retros could use a tap of the reset button, consider giving Outro a shot.

Time and again, the two largest political parties in India, the Congress and the BJP (along with the numerous regional parties) have accused the winners of Electronic Voting Machines (#EVM) frauds. As an Electronics Engineer and a practising Software Engineer, I haven’t seen till now any convincing proof of a mass-scale hacking or technology holes in the EVMs made in #India. A truly transparent and fraud-proof method of electing leaders will be to have a fight till the death between the candidates, like wild animals — but that is not an option that is available in a democracy! The name of the game is PROCESS improvement and not technology elimination. In the past too, in 2004 I have written on the same topic of running elections. My understanding of EVM are from common knowledge and from the public manual published by Election Commission of India (ECI) on their website — the recent one was titled “Manual on Electronic Voting Machine and VVPAT, July 2018” (the image on top of this page was from this manual). I agree, in many parts of the world, there have been problems with EVMs especially in the USA with its countless vendors manufacturing countless varieties (due to varying state laws and their autonomy in procurement). But the fact is (an irony too) that the ones made for Election Commission of India are not sophisticated, they are not smart (No Modern OS on them to run anything else, which is a blessing in this case of super speciality use-case) or networked in any fashion to the outside world (Internet or elsewhere). The way to do fraud, in these scenarios, will be during the process of data tabulation and reporting, which in my guess will be super-hard and nearly impossible with poll observers of all parties in every counting stations. This latest one by Syed Shuja is laughable — transmitting radio signals to a device which doesn’t have any antennas or radio of any sort — how will such a hack work, is beyond any electronics I studied. My interest in this subject is from a Technology angle and I am NOT claiming (I am not an investigating agency or knowledgable on the field of security) that no fraud has been done by the BJP or the Congress or anyone else in the past, but so far no technology proof by any of the ‘claimed’ hackers that have been published are convincing for an engineer like me. When I posted the above in my Facebook wall, a friend replied with a reference to an article on The Hindu by Mr G Sampath titled “Why EVMs must go”. To me, the article feels to be a case of cherry picking for a pre-concluded narrative. I believe EVMs can be better audited and the whole process can be made (closer to being) fool-proof if our respected leaders put their minds together. For their failure to improve the process, throwing the baby in the cold water is not a solution, it is regressive and a disservice to the poor of this country. In setting the clock back to paper voting, I see no difference to those that are being followed by Indian Nationalists who keep talking of a superior Indian race before the European invasion. No one believing on democracy can have a second opinion that the public needs to have complete transparency and trust in the process of electing their Government representatives. I will say the Citizens should ask his/her parliamentarians and the candidates when they come seeking for votes for a better and improved Electronic Voting process. Of course, there are the Hon’ble Courts of Law too. We need an EVM that is constantly improved, benchmarked and audited — by a neutral/respected body or the United Nations (controversial but I will throw that in for experts to deliberate). As my security friends have pointed out, it will be welcome if the Election Commission of India publishes the source codes and architecture of their machines — security by obscurity is not a good idea in this day and age — this move will allow researchers from around the world to validate the technology and that may finally put this ghost to rest. In any case, throwing away EVMs in the search of a utopia through Paper ballots appears vain for me. I will urge our national parties to be innovative on their respective accusations against each other — which are much needed for a vibrant democracy — newer accusations will be interesting for the common man while reading the NEWS and not these FUDs! -- -- A Founder Catalyst and a Microsoft Regional Director (Honorary).

It includes not just weird theoretical expeditions like this one, but a bunch of personal stories about my time reporting about the industry, and a decent number of hopefully-entertaining insults. These excerpts, meanwhile, should be considered drafts — I welcome feedback. Part 2 of this essay is now live and can be read here. It’s fairly easy, in 2019, to talk about the concrete reasons bitcoin grew out of the cypherpunk movement and has long-term promise. Our digital landscape is increasingly locked down by central gatekeepers who monitor our behavior and leverage that data to influence us. Meanwhile, our monetary system is increasingly digital, but the current default administrators are banks who are quick to block even legal behaviors at the behest of governments. Bitcoin — and maybe blockchain tech more generally — can provide a technological counterweight to these trends. But the chaotic trend towards digital authoritarianism will eventually reach some form of equilibrium. It’s part of a broader upheaval triggered by the growth of the internet and related digital tech, and we are still figuring out how to live in the new world we’ve created. This doesn’t mean these issues will be settled for the better: we can look at GDPR in Europe and Social Credit in China as two diametrically opposed paths towards a ‘solution.’ In the U.S. and other parts of the world where more direct and broad action hasn’t been taken, the future feels much less predictable, but eventually, a new status quo will emerge. Things are currently moving in a troubling direction: with only market forces and (to a much lesser extent) vague ethical pressures guiding them, mainstream platforms like YouTube and Facebook are simply blocking or removing unsavory or controversial content. This points to a future much like the past, with big media platforms controlling what you see (if to a lesser degree), while continuing to harvest data on users to sell ads, in ways much more intrusive than the old model. But assuming things continue down this path, we will eventually (within the next 20 years, I’d guess) see a broad backlash, in which cryptocurrency and other digital privacy technologies will play a major role. We’ll see upsides and downsides, with things like money laundering and tax evasion balanced against greater individual freedom. Whatever the details, fundamental elements of society — including those that don’t directly connect with technology — will change. Similar technology-driven 1 social changes have occurred many times in human history. One of the most compelling high-level analyses of such processes comes from a line of 20th century media scholars including Harold Innis, his pupil Marshall McLuhan, and McLuhan’s student and collaborator Walter Ong. Though Ong was American, this intellectual lineage is known as the Toronto School. At the broadest level, the Toronto School and their successors argue that major shifts in communication technology, such as the transitions first to print and then to broadcast media, have widespread and fundamental impacts not just on societies, but on human consciousness. We’re living through another one of those transitions, driven by digital and network technologies, which among other things radically compress the experience of time, and shorten human attention spans. The broad adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain tech could trigger a similarly profound shift in society and consciousness, possibly in a much different direction. But first, digging deeper into a real historical example may make you more comfortable with this kind of prognostication. Let’s take a moment to look at the impact of what some think is the most important technology in human history: mass-produced text, a.k.a. print. Back in the 15th-16th centuries, the mass production of books was a novelty in Europe (movable type first emerged in China in the 8th century — take that, Western chauvinists). Because religion was the pretty much undisputed dominant ideology of the time, this was most relevant to the Roman Catholic Church. Church authorities opposed the mass dissemination of religious texts, particularly translations of the Bible into vernacular languages, because it risked (basically) making it easier for lay people to think for themselves. The church saw itself as the only valid interpreter of holy texts, and holy texts were nearly the only human knowledge that mattered. Of course, these were pretty self-centered arguments from the church, which was also highly authoritarian and centralized, and had a lot of secular power thanks to its monopoly on ideology. And it was right to be threatened — the first Gutenberg Bible was printed (in Latin) around 1454, laying the foundation for the printing of various bibles in English and German in the 1530s, which poured gasoline on the Protestant Reformation (kicked off by Martin Luther in 1517) by making scripture, so to speak, ‘open source.’ Protestantism, in turn, was a precursor of individualism, critical thought, Enlightenment, secularization, and, very broadly, what we consider ‘modernity.’ The Catholic Church has undoubtedly lost power because printing technology destroyed its monopoly on ideology. But new power structures came to replace it — most importantly, in the 20th and 21st century, the secular religion of modernist, small-l liberalism in politics, culture, and science. After a period of upheaval, that new system established its own (again) centralized control apparatus, from elite periodicals in the 18th and 19th centuries, on to corporate television, radio, and newspaper networks from roughly the 1920s through the early 2000s. Though allowing more diverse narratives than the religion handed down from Rome to medieval European peasants, the high cost of things like television production and newspaper printing ultimately bound them in a cozy relationship with the very leaders they were supposed to be offering neutral perspectives on 2. Just as printed vernacular Bibles had essentially made Christianity free to fork, social networks later made it possible for anyone to share their interpretation of world events (or just made-up facts). This technology has again triggered a collapse of the status quo. At the risk of offending just about everyone, both conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones and political agitators like the protestors of the Arab Spring have a shot at becoming the Martin Luther of this transformation — a guide for where power can find its new ‘natural’ distribution, given the new state of technological play. The decentralization of knowledge can both give activists more power, and leave the weak-minded more vulnerable to ideas with the complicated truth status of myth. These conflicting, deep, and profound social changes reflect the best-known of Marshall McLuhan’s observations about communication technology: that “The medium is the message.” What matters about the internet, in short, is not what people use it to say to the world or to each other, but the way the underlying technology structures that communication. In the case of the internet, that includes its geographic reach, its high velocity, and the relative difficulty (compared at least to broadcast television or print newspapers) power elites have of controlling its content. But McLuhan thought much more broadly and poetically about media 3 and their messages. For one, he thought critically about things we don’t usually consider media, most notably the electric light bulb. McLuhan regarded electric light as the ultimate ‘pure’ medium, which had no content as such, but nonetheless transformed the fundamental structure of human life through its impact on reshaping communication. He inherited this broad approach from Innis, who found his way into thinking about media through a study of railways, which he also considered a ‘medium’ in the sense that they connected people (as well as literally carrying communications like mail). McLuhan’s subtle approach is clearest in the various abstract criteria he uses to analyze media. For instance, McLuhan argues that print is a ‘cool’ medium, because it requires the reader to abstract their body from the world and consider ‘pure’ ideas. This, he argues, is why the Enlightenment arose from societies with printed alphabets 4. By contrast, he saw radio and television as ‘warm’ media that connected with people on an emotional rather than rational level. McLuhan argued that the speed and ‘warmth’ of electronic media would lead us back to a less rational and more tribal society, a prediction made in the 1950s and 1960s that we are, unfortunately, seeing proven true today 5. Innis had a similar set of bedrock classifications that are more relevant to our look at blockchain. One of his key works, Empire and Communications, examined the role of media in establishing, growing, and maintaining large empires. Using this rubric, he posited certain media as “time binding” because they carried a message into the future and assured the longevity of an empire. In this category he included things like Egyptian pyramids or Greek temples. Other media, such as parchment or the telegraph, are “space binding,” because they can travel quickly and (in conjunction with other means) extend the contemporaneous reach of a center of power. Networked digital information is fundamentally this sort of “space binding” technology, with immense reach and speed but inherently limited durability — it exists on one or a few hard drives and is projected across distances, but isn’t necessarily recorded or stored at the endpoint. It’s also not stored with any permanence at its origin: though we’re lucky in the short term to have things like the Internet Archive, we already know that much of the early internet is simply lost. The transitory nature of many digital storage formats means private archives degrade and disappear in a matter of decades, or even years — Zip disks and compact discs are far more fragile than paper 6. Equally important, systems like Twitter are explicitly designed for ephemerality — even if your tweets are dug up later to embarrass you, they’re mainly meant to be seen for a few hours. The sheer volume of content on social networks, moreover, makes them more disposable communication. The most fundamentally significant feature of blockchain technology is that it upends the tradeoff between time-binding and space-binding capacities of media. It has the speed and ubiquity of any digital media — you can read a public blockchain from anywhere with an internet connection. But unlike making data accessible on the internet, writing to a public blockchain, whether we mean sending a purely financial transaction or literally writing data into a distributed ledger, has much more permanence — maybe the permanence of paper, or maybe the permanence of stone. It’s certainly less like a telegraph than a pyramid, but a digital one, visible from anywhere on the internet. That durability, like the durability of the pyramids, comes with a cost — literally, the economic cost of writing to the blockchain. Transaction fees, block rewards, and governance systems like difficulty adjustment create incentives to keep a public blockchain going without the direct involvement of any fragile individual. While a pyramid’s durability relies on the natural properties of things like stone, blockchain’s durability relies on social properties, specifically market economics. Note that I’m emphasizing, here and elsewhere, public blockchains. These are systems, like bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be accessed, used, and maintained (‘mined’) by anyone with the right equipment and knowledge, and which attract maintainers using built-in economic incentives. These are crucially different from various ‘private’ blockchains run by coalitions — so-called “permissioned blockchains.” 7 These do not have the particular features that are most significant for deep, long-term social transformation. Most importantly, because they’re not publicly minable or (in many cases) usable, there’s no reason to think they’re substantially more durable or long-lived than any other private system, lacking either a foundation of social buy-in from a mass of users (what we’ve called the Magic of Bitcoin), or distributed incentives to continually attract maintainers. If a critical mass of the specific actors in a private blockchain disappear, the entire thing collapses. Even the durability of any particular public blockchain depends on dynamics that we don’t yet fully understand — there’s no guarantee that a chain you launch today will exist three weeks from now, much less in a century. This stage of widespread experimentation has likely produced an array of still-unknown security flaws, for instance, and we have little clue what the long-term social dynamics around smaller blockchains will look like. And, of course, the market is such a key part of any decentralized blockchain that it’s hard to imagine the systems surviving a large-scale transition to another form of economic organization. But it’s entirely plausible that a widely-adopted and technically sound public blockchain like bitcoin will last centuries 8. It is simultaneously invisible and durable, existing everywhere at once, but strongly resistant to tampering or other damage. It is an invisible obelisk, both universal and, as much as any feeble human effort, timeless. Continue to McLuhan on the Blockchain Part 2: The Impact of Endurance Notes: 1 ‘Technological determinism’ is the general premise that technology is the primary driver of changes in human society. It’s a thesis with various complications and problems, but it’s my basic analytical perspective here (and, frankly, most of the time). 2 See, first, last, and always: Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky, Manufacturing Consent. 3 “Media” is the plural of “medium” — a collective term for things like television or the written word. This is not to be confused with “the media,” a blanket term usually applied to the media industry, rather than media technologies. 4 As I pointed out, movable type emerged in Asia long before the West, but McLuhan argues that pictographic languages like Chinese, because each symbol represents a concept instead of a sound, aren’t as conducive to depersonalizing reason as Arabic and European alphabetic languages. It’s a frankly Eurocentric argument that I’m not sure holds up to scrutiny, but there you go. 5 McLuhan didn’t foresee that the internet and digital text would wind up more important than broadcast media, but tweets, memes, and Facebook arguments have much more in common with the emotionality of broadcast media than the rationality of print. 6 And paper, in this new context, is no longer fast, but slow — not space-binding, but time-binding. 7 While this designation is most associated with attempts by companies like banks or shipping companies to benefit from certain parts of blockchain without adopting the whole package, it can also be applied to some systems using the “proof of stake” security architecture. This is a promising, more energy-efficient answer to bitcoin’s security system, but a few such systems hold ‘elections’ or use other social processes to select key maintainers. This loses them some of the benefits of proof-of-work public blockchains. 8 To be very clear: I’m not claiming bitcoin itself will last centuries. I’m sympathetic to the argument that bitcoin could be supplanted by something with all the same fundamental properties, but also some set of improvements that make it more useful or otherwise superior. -- -- 1 Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*94-woO6oFTYRL4F2.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*94-woO6oFTYRL4F2.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*94-woO6oFTYRL4F2.jpg"

Com a coleta de dados do cliente concluída o próximo passo é especificar o que será desenvolvido no sistema, adentrando em um nível técnico especificando as funcionalidades que o sistema terá, exemplificando o API, que significa Interface de Programação da Aplicação, ou seja, todas as aplicações possíveis de serem realizadas no sistema. Nesse instante o planejamento dos cenários de teste de aceitação já podem ser implementados por serem os últimos testes a serem executados pelo cliente obtendo a resposta se o sistema será aprovado ou não. Terminada essa tarefa, os testes de sistema são iniciados onde a equipe de teste realizaram o teste baseado na especificação técnica do sistema que possui todas as suas operações que serão executadas. Partimos então para a elaboração da arquitetura do sistema, onde o arquiteto de software define qual será a arquitetura do sistema; se será em camadas; quais serão as tecnologias usadas para desenvolver o sistema; quais as tecnologias que se adaptam para desenvolver a solução que deve ser desenvolvida e assim por diante. Depois que a arquitetura é elaborada, passamos para a codificação onde os programadores irão atuar, codificando o sistema com a arquitetura definida. Durante a codificação serão realizados em paralelo os testes de unidade e integração por serem testes realizados por programadores.

We’re building this in Berlin (YEAY) and Malta with the WOM Protocol. The youth still govern the future trends for digital interactions and apps, so watching GenZ create online, we can catch glimpses of the future of digital, marketing, branding, advertising and mobile products and online to offline (O2O) experiences. I wanted to dive in, in May, 2019 to give an update of what’s actually popular among this generation and trending. The 2019 State of Gen Z report by Zebra IQ uncovers new data and trends on Generation Z as consumers, employees, and trendsetters. Here I’m going to quickly summarize some of their findings. The top apps among Gen Z reveal important preferences and interests compared to older generations. Born between 1995 and 2010, Gen Z has grown up with the internet and smartphones and spent their entire lives adapting to new technology. This influence is transforming major consumption patterns online such as YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, to name just a few. Video consumption is increasing, as well as memes, interactive stories (micro video) and various streaming services (gaming, niche, social commerce, etc…). This generation illustrates many trends. Zebra IQ, a marketing and insights tech company, recently released a report detailing Gen Z ‘s online habits and interests, including their favorite apps, popular slang, and most-liked brands and influencers. Twitch lets millions of viewers tune in to watch live video games and other creative content. Reddit lets users build their own community pages and offers organized discussion on popular topics and niche interests. The “front page” of the internet is popular also among GenZ men. It’s raw, honest and very informative for any niche interest or mainstream craving for info and memes. Reddit is like “forums” 2.0. There are “sub-Reddits” on nearly everything that is created by the community, not brands. This means Reddit is a quasi decentralized platform. Gen Z are peer-to-peer oriented, many of whom won’t even have a Facebook account. TikTok lets users make short video clips with a range of effects. The format is similar to Vine, the short-form video platform that operated from 2012 to 2017 and gave birth to social media influencers like Jake and Logan Paul. TikTok has gone especially viral in South and East Asia, being a Chinese app but has a surprising global traction among teens. These are just North American numbers, globally this app could one day rival Instagram according to some analysts. ByteDance is perhaps the startups that’s the best at developing & marketing apps in the world. I hope this article has given you a quick overview of how Gen Z are the ultimate digital transformers and making the following more popular than ever. Gen Z is truly demonstrating a lot of trends that have the potential to transform social media, marketing, advertising, branding and the internet as we know it. -- -- CEO at YEAY / https://womprotocol.io/ / Blockchain Entrepreneur/ Gen Z Entrepreneurship Advocate.

Tools we use communicate and collaborate every day, from smartphones to Google Docs and Salesforce, did not exist 20 years ago. Many tech workers rely on an even newer wave of tools, like Slack, Figma and Notion, that did not even exist five or so years ago. At the same time, 25–30% of the US population are gig workers in some form — representing an entirely new model for work that did not exist 10 years ago. Yet these visible changes represent only a part of what is changing. In order to understand the future of work, we should take a broader and more systemic view, including of structural changes that are less immediately visible. Remixing Work analyzes the development of the future of work at four levels: These levels are distinct but also highly interrelated. For example, underlying forces and new technologies are changing the market structure of most industries. In many industries like the internet and retail, the largest players have a scale that never existed before and those largest players are gaining share. In the 15 years from 1997 to 2012, the market share of the 4 largest retail firms nearly doubled from 7.9% to 13.5%. At the same time, completely new business models are possible for small, niche players, e.g., top YouTube influencers who earn more than $10M per year. In contrast, the prospects for the mid-scale players in these markets is somewhat grim. This represents the emerging barbell structure of many industries — massive scale on one end and micro scale on the other. These market dynamics have led to new opportunities for firms and individual careers. At the intersection of the internet and retail, online retail is a canonical example: Shopify has built a hugely successful business powering the long tail of online retail. It provides all the key infrastructure needed to start an online store quickly, cheaply and with little risk. It has enabled all kinds of niche businesses to launch — everything from Christian jewelry to menswear styles of clothing with cuts for women — and they now have more than one million merchants on their platform. If you have bought anything from a niche online brand, you likely have purchased from a Shopify-powered store. Not every Shopify store is profitable enough or sustainable enough to live on, but there are plenty of examples of success, like achieving $1M in sales within 8 months of launching. This possibility has unlocked new career choices for individuals, e.g., creating a niche consumer brand and starting an online store. That type of career has very different education implications from a traditional career in retail — different skills and knowledge are needed and traditional credentials aren’t important. The specific dynamics and implications are different across industries, but the importance of understanding this interplay between levels — economy, market, firm and individual — is universal for analyzing the future of work. In some ways the future of work is already here, but there is far more to come.

Thanks to its simplicity, popularity and huge support community, we can make a lot of cool stuff. The only limit is your imagination. Let me introduce you another simple life hack: porting JavaScript games to Arduino. Just a few steps, and you can enjoy JavaScript games on your board. Side note: A PHPoC Shield can let your Arduino become embedded Web server, you can host any JavaScript Web game on your board. Last time I checked, there is nearly 300 KB free space on the shield. Not too much, but quite enough for some JavaScript games. If the file size is too large, you can store your files on a CDN instead of uploading it directly to PHPoC Shield. There are lots of JS games available on the Internet, open and free for you to download. This time, let’s have fun with the Floppy bird! 1 x Arduino Uno 1 x PHPoC Wi-Fi Shield for Arduino 1 x Button (Any button is okay. Here I use my Grove button) Basically, I found an open-source JavaScript code for Floppy bird. The remaining job is straightforward. Since the size of the code is not too large (< 250 KB), I can upload it to PHPoC shield. A WebSocket event listener needs to be added in JS code, so that the game can be updated upon receiving WebSocket data from the server. Arduino ← → PHPoC Shield ← → Web browser Something to note here: Arduino with PHPoC shield can act as a Web server as well as WebSocket server, while the web browser is a client. Why WebSocket? It makes sense to keep a persistent connection between the client (web browser) and server (Arduino with PHPoC Shield) via WebSocket, since the data (game control signal) tends to be exchanged frequently. User interacts with a button physically. The state of the button is used to control the bird. I simply use a button for game console. Just a basic GPIO stuff, if the button pressed, the server will send data to the client via WebSocket, telling the client to update the bird’s movement. Actually you can choose any hardware components for game console. For example, a touch sensor may be good for this game. It’s totally up to you! To make this work, just flash the web files (floppy_bird.php and main.js) available to PHPoC shield. Don’t forget to upload floppy_bird.ino to Arduino board. That’s all!

We can all do one simple thing to help.,Written by Wanbin,Wanbin,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Wanbin Follow -- Listen Share The Amazon rainforest is burning. It’s the last thing we want in the face of climate change and its catastrophic consequences. All that CO2 being released into air, and all that CO2 absorption that won’t happen after the fire destroyed the trees, in addition to the lost O2 production capacity, it is leaving me out of breath, and probably anyone who needs oxygen to live. I have always been aware of and concerned about climate change, and have tried adopting some environmentally friendly habits in life to ease my own feeling of guit. But I would so appreciate something that is easy to implement consistently, and better yet, something that I do, a lot, everyday — so that its benefits can accumulate. And I found a good one, fellas, and I would like to share with you: Use Ecosia to do your internet searches, and plant trees along the way. On average, with 45 searches you’ll help plant one tree. It’s a legit search engine service powered by Microsoft Bing. It’s like Google, but if it reaches the scale of Google, the CO2 it would be able to absorb would equal 15% of global emissions! So, let’s help that cause, by going to https://www.ecosia.org. When we search the web using Google or any other search engines, we usually see some relevant ads. If we click on them, the search engine gets a little bit of money from that advertiser. What makes a difference is that Ecosia uses more than 80% of its profits generated from ads to support tree planting programs. Planting a tree might cost less than what you think, at 0.2 euro per tree. Given the average click rate, it takes about 45 searches to plant a tree. When I’m writing this, Ecosia has 8 million active users (plus you!), and has planted over 65 million trees. Ecosia doesn’t only plant trees, it also supports other programs where appropriate, including one in Brazil that supports forest regrowth through firefighting. Here is an excerpt from their website: “We also have a project in Brazil that aims to regrow 25 million trees through firefighting in ten years. Forest fires are a major threat to the Mata Atlântica, and by employing people to manage them, we can restore over 10,000 hectares at a very inexpensive price.” This is very important because fires destroy mature trees in a blink. And it can take 100+ years for trees to grow back into what they were before fire. Shrinking forests also feed back into a vicious loop for itself. Scientists in 2016 warned that 20% deforestation of Amazon could turn Amazon to savannah, due to combined effects of reduced rainfall, climate change and increased fires. Back then, the deforestation rate was already at 17%; we are really close to that tipping point. (source) So while tree planting is an important effort in combating climate change, it is vital to protect our existing forests. We need programs like Ecosia’s to support land management and firefighting; we also need governments around the world to act in a responsible way — as we’ll see below, government policies are a main force in this. Over the years, the rate of deforestation has varied a lot. In Brazil, the main industries driving deforestation are logging, mining, and farming, with the beef industry accounting for 80% of the forest reduction (source). As we can see from the graph above, deforestation rate was on a sharp decline between years 2004 and 2012, and remained steady until 2017. According to a study in 2015, conservation policies during that time period contributed significantly to the curbing of deforestation (source). On the contrary, anti-environmental policies accelerate deforestation. Since Brazilian President Bolsonaro came to power in January 2019, he has weakened the environment ministry and encouraged mining and farming interests (source). In July alone, the rainforest lost 2253 square kilometers to deforestation, increased by 278% from July 2018 (source). For scale, Amazon rainforest covers 2.1 million square miles, with an estimated 390 billion trees (source). That gives us roughly 185k trees per square mile, or 71k trees per square kilometer. So in July, we lost about 160 million trees! It’s depressing to think that deforestation at that speed could easily erase the trees being planted elsewhere. But that’s why we need all kinds of efforts, including actively making our voices heard to push for the social and political changes we wish for. Besides supporting environment-benefiting organizations like Ecosia through our clicks everyday, another habit we can adopt is simply consume less beef. Perhaps shocking to some, livestock contribute as much greenhouse gases as transport. And among all livestock, cattle accounts for the majority of the emissions, largely due to enteric fermentation (a digestive process of ruminants that generates large amounts of methane), and feed production (a direct cause for much of the deforestation at Amazon forests). There are so many things we can do to support local organizations in Brazil, to put pressure on policy-makers, and to create changes through our own acts and choices in life. This article contains more suggestions, including using Ecosia: https://www.cnet.com/how-to/the-amazon-rainforest-fires-are-still-burning-whats-happening-and-how-you-can-help/ The impacts of Amazon forest fire reach far beyond climate change, including putting enormous stress on biodiversity in the world.

Bob wrote an excellent article on closures and capture lists here, and I don’t want to repeat any of that. Instead, I wanted to compare the use of value and reference types with closures and capture lists. To begin, closures capture references to variables. This is the starting point. The above prints: 1: 5 has address: 0x000056174d7dc1d8Running closure2: 5 has address: 0x000056174d7dc1d85Running closure2: 6 has address: 0x000056174d7dc1d86 Even though we run the same closure twice, the output is different, because the variable x has been incremented between the closure runs. What if we reference an instance of a class (reference type) from within the closure then? Something like this: I’m using the function withUnsafePointer() to peek at the memory addresses. A few observations about this snippet: To “lock” the value of a variable into a closure and have it be insulated from subsequent reassignments, we could use capture lists. Some modifications are required: Observations: I tried doing the same with reference types. I included an additional print statement, to show that fooCopy === foo (i.e. that fooCopy is a non-immutable variable that points to the same underlying object as foo). Observation and lesson: You can “shallow-lock” a reference type using a capture list into a closure, but not “deeper” references. Therefore, in this case, the value of foo.x changes between closure runs, even though foo has been “locked in” (shallowly) through the capture list. -- -- https://fabianterh.me | https://twitter.com/fabianterh Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*xRFvZffpJiGnhOBQf3GuAA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*xRFvZffpJiGnhOBQf3GuAA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*xRFvZffpJiGnhOBQf3GuAA.jpeg"

C,No Author URL,N/A,13 min read,Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ray C Follow -- Share 上面的圖示清楚表示了網站體系架構。如果你不是經驗豐富的網頁開發人員，可能會覺得它很複雜。在我們深入探究每個部分之前，下面的描述應該會讓我們更容易上手。 一位用戶在 Google 上搜尋「森林中的濃霧和陽光」。第一個結果應該會來自於 Storyblocks — 我們最大的照片和向量圖網站。當用戶點擊結果，瀏覽器將畫面轉向到圖片的詳細資訊頁面。事實上，過程就是瀏覽器在後台將請求發送到 DNS 服務器，以查詢如何聯繫 Storyblocks 網站，然後發送請求。 當請求到達負載平衡器，它會在我們當時運行網站的大約十台網站服務器中，隨機選擇一個來處理請求。網站服務器從我們的暫存服務中查尋有關該圖像的一些訊息，並從資料庫中獲取有關該圖像的其他資料。由於我們注意到圖像的顏色配置文件尚未被計算，我們將「顏色配置文件」工作發送到作業佇列，然後我們的作業服務器會對其進行異步處理，並根據結果適當地更新資料庫。 接下來，我們嘗試將照片的標題作為輸入，向全文檢索服務發送請求，來查尋相似的照片。用戶剛好以會員的身份登錄 Storyblocks 網站，因此我們從帳戶服務中查尋其帳戶訊息。最後，我們向資料串流觸發一個頁面查看事件，以記錄到我們的雲端系統，並最終加載到我們的資料庫中，它被用來幫助分析人員們回答有關業務的問題。 現在，服務器將視圖渲染為 HTML，首先通過負載平衡器，然後將其發送回用戶的瀏覽器。該頁面包含我們加載到與 CDN 連接雲端系統中的 JavaScript 和 CSS 內容，因此用戶的瀏覽器聯繫 CDN 以檢索內容。最後，瀏覽器將頁面可視化，呈現給用戶觀看。 接下來，我將帶你逐步了解每個組件，並為每個部分提供完整的介紹，同時帶給你一個良好的思維模式，來思考未來的網站體系架構。 DNS 代表「域名系統」，它是使全球資訊網（world wide web）成為可能的主要技術。最基本來說，DNS 提供從域名（例如 google.com）到 IP 位址（例如 85. 129. 83. 120）的鍵/值查尋，這是你的電腦將請求路由到適當位址的必要服務器。與電話號碼類似，域名和 IP 位址之間的區別就是「打電話給 John Doe」和「打電話給 201–867–5309」之間的區別。就像你過去需要一本電話簿來查尋 John 的電話號碼一樣，你需要 DNS 來查尋域名的 IP 地址。因此，你可以將 DNS 視為互聯網的電話簿。 我們將跳過更多詳細介紹，因為這對於我們的整體介紹並不重要。 在深入研究負載平衡之前，我們需要退後一步來討論水平與垂直的應用擴展。它們是什麼，以及有什麼區別？在此 StackOverflow 貼文中可以讓你非常簡單地了解，水平擴展意味著向資源池中添加更多虛擬機器來進行擴展，而垂直擴展意味著向現有虛擬機器中添加更多的功能（例如 CPU、RAM）來進行擴展。 在網站開發中，你（幾乎）總是想用水平擴展，因為為了簡單起見，東西會中斷、服務器隨時會崩潰、網路會出問題、整個資料中心有時會斷線。擁有多台服務器可以使你為中斷做計劃，以讓應用程式繼續運行。換句話說，你的應用程式是「容錯的」。其次，水平擴展允許你藉由使它們各自在不同的服務器上運行，來最小化結合應用程式後端的不同部分（網站服務器、資料庫、某服務等）。最後，你可能會達到無法再垂直擴展的程度。世界上沒有夠大的虛擬機器來執行你所有應用程式的計算。儘管這適用於規模較小的公司，但可以將 Google 的搜尋平台視為一個典型的例子。例如，Storyblocks 網站在任何時間點運行 150 到 400 個 AWS EC2 事例。通過垂直擴展來提供全部計算能力將會是一個挑戰。 好，回到負載平衡器。它們是使水平擴展成為可能的魔術棒。它們將請求傳入到通常彼此克隆或鏡像的眾多應用程式服務器之一，並將回應從應用程式服務器發送回用戶端。它們當中的任何一個都該會以相同的方式處理請求，因此只需在服務器之間分配請求，這樣就不會使它們過載。 就這樣。從概念上來說，負載平衡器相當簡單能理解。事實上肯定有許多復雜之處，但在此處無需深入了解。 綜觀來看，網站應用程式服務器的描述相對簡單。它們處理用戶請求的核心業務邏輯，並將 HTML 發送回用戶的瀏覽器。為了完成工作，他們通常與各種後端基礎架構進行通信，例如資料庫、暫存層、作業佇列、搜尋服務，其他微服務，資料/日誌記錄佇列等等。如上所述，為了處理用戶請求，通常將至少兩個（通常是更多）插入負載平衡器。 你應該知道，應用服務器的實行需要選擇一種特定的語言（Node.js、Ruby、PHP、Scala、Java、C＃、.NET等）和該語言的網站 MVC 框架（Express for Node.js、Ruby on Rails、Play for Scala、Laravel for PHP 等等）。但是，深入探討這些語言和框架的細節不在本文的討論範圍之內。 每個現代的網站應用程式都利用一個或多個資料庫來存儲訊息。資料庫提供了定義資料結構、插入、查尋、更新或刪除現有資料，以及對資料進行計算等方法。在大多數情況下，網站應用程式服務器與作業服務器直接進行通信。此外，每個後端服務可能都有自己的資料庫，並與應用程式的其餘部分隔離。 儘管我避免深入探討每個體系結構中的特定技術，但重要的來了，資料庫的下個細節：SQL 和 NoSQL。 SQL 代表「結構化查詢語言」，於 1970 年代發明，提供了一種標準的查詢關係資料集的方法，讓廣大的使用者進行訪問。SQL 資料庫將資料存儲在透過用 ID（通常為整數）連接在一起的列表中。讓我們來看看一個為用戶儲存歷史地址訊息的簡單範例。你可能有兩個列表，用戶列表和用戶地址列表，透過用戶的 ID 連接在一起。參見下圖的簡化版本。這些表被連接，因為 user_addresses 中的 user_id 列是 users 表中 id 列的「外鍵」。 如果你對 SQL 不太了解，我強烈建議你逐步學習，就像你可以在 Khan Academy 上找到的課程那樣。它在網站開發中無所不在，因此你至少要了解基礎知識，以便正確地構建應用程式。 NoSQL 代表「非 SQL」，它是一組較新的資料庫技術，可以處理大型網站應用程式可能產生的大量資料（大多數 SQL 變體不能很好的水平擴展，並且只能垂直擴展到某個點）。如果你對 NoSQL 一無所知，建議從以下介紹入手： 對了，總體來說，整個行業都在將 SQL 當作 NoSQL 資料庫的介面。因此，如果你不了解 SQL，那麼你真的應該學習 SQL，現今幾乎無法避開它。 暫存服務提供了一個簡單的鍵/值資料存儲，使你可以在接近 0（1）的時間內保存和查尋資訊。應用程式通常利用暫存服務來保存珍貴的計算結果，以便從暫存中檢索結果，而不用在下次需要時重新計算。應用程式可能會從資料庫查詢暫存結果、調用外部服務和給定 URL 的 HTML 等結果。以下是應用程式中的一些真實範例： 兩種最廣泛被使用的暫存服務器技術是 Redis 和 Memcache。我將在另一篇文章中詳細介紹。 大多數網站應用程式需要在後台異步執行一些與用戶請求沒有直接相關的工作。例如，Google 需要對整個網際網路進行爬蟲並編制索引，以便返回搜尋結果。在你搜尋時，它不會每次都這樣做。而是藉由異步爬蟲，一路更新搜尋索引。 儘管有不同的體系結構可以完成異步工作，但最普遍的是我稱之為「作業佇列」的體系結構。它由兩個部分組成：一個需要運行的「作業」佇列，和一個或多個運行該作業佇列的作業服務器（通常被稱為「工人」）。 作業佇列需要進行異步來儲存作業列表。儘管大多數應用程式最終都需要某種優先級的排程系統，最簡單的是先進先出（first-in-first-out、FIFO）佇列。每當應用程式需要按照某種常規，或是根據用戶操作確定要運行作業時，它只會將適當地將作業添加到佇列中。 例如，Storyblocks 網站利用在幕後的工作佇列來讓我們許多交易得以實現。我們運行作業以對影片和照片進行編碼、處理 CSV 檔案以進行後設資料標記、匯總用戶統計資訊和發送重置密碼的電子郵件等。我們從簡單的 FIFO 佇列開始，現在我們用到優先級佇列，以確保像是發送重置密碼電子郵件之類的緊急操作能盡快完成。 作業服務器處理作業。他們會不斷詢問作業佇列是否有工作要做，如果有，他們將作業從佇列丟出並執行。基本語言和框架的選擇與網站服務器一樣多，因此在本文中我將不做詳細介紹。 許多網絡應用程式都支持某種搜尋功能，當用戶提供文字輸入（通常稱為「查詢」），應用程式返回最「相關」的結果。支持此功能的技術通常被稱為「全文搜尋」，它利用反向索引快速查尋包含關鍵字的文檔。 儘管可以直接從某些資料庫中進行全文搜尋（例如 MySQL 支持全文搜尋），但通常運用單獨的「搜尋服務」來計算和儲存反向索引並提供查詢介面。當今最受歡迎的全文搜尋平台是 Elasticsearch，其他選擇還有 Sphinx 和 Apache Solr。 一旦應用程式達到一定規模，就有可能將某些「服務」劃分為單獨的應用程式來運行。它們不會暴露於外部，但是會與其他服務進行交互。例如，Storyblocks 網站具有多項營運和計劃服務： 如今，公司的存續取決於他們如何利用資料。幾乎每個應用程式一旦達到一定規模，就會利用資料管道來收集、儲存和分析資料。典型的管道具有三個主要階段： 架構圖中未顯示的另一步驟：從應用程式和服務的資料庫將資料加載到資料庫中。以 Storyblocks 網站為例，我們每晚將 VideoBlocks、AudioBlocks、Storyblocks、帳戶服務和貢獻者入口資料庫加載到 Redshift 中。藉由將核心業務資料與我們的用戶交互事件資料一起定位，可以為我們的分析師提供一個整體資料集。 根據 AWS 的說法，「雲端是一種透過網路儲存、訪問和共享資料的簡單且可擴展的方式」。你可以用它來儲存或訪問在本地檔案系統上儲存的任何內容，其優點是可以通過基於 HTTP 的 RESTful API 交互。目前為止，雅馬遜的 S3 產品是最受歡迎的雲端，我們在 Storyblocks 網站廣泛依賴它來儲存影片、照片和音訊檔案、CSS 和 JavaScript，以及我們的用戶事件資料等等。 CDN(Content Delivery Network) 代表「內容傳遞網路」，該技術提供了一種在網站上為靜態 HTML、CSS、JavaScript 和圖像之類的檔案提供服務的方法，速度比從單個原始服務器提供這些資源要快得多。它的工作原理是將內容分佈於世界各地的許多「邊緣」服務器上，以讓用戶最終從「邊緣」服務器而不是原始服務器下載檔案。例如在下圖中，在西班牙的用戶從具有紐約原始服務器的網站發出請求，但是該頁面的靜態檔案是從英格蘭的 CDN「邊緣」服務器加載的，從而避免了許多跨大西洋的 HTTP 緩慢請求。 查看這篇文章以獲得更全面的介紹。通常網站應用程式應始終使用 CDN 來提供 CSS、JavaScript、圖像、影片和任何其他檔案。一些應用程式也可能能夠利用 CDN 來提供靜態 HTML 頁面。 感謝您的閱讀，我試著將生活與自己所學到的知識，以平易近人的方式傳達給正在努力進步的同好，甚至是領域之外卻有興趣的人，您的鼓勵也是我進步的動力。 本文翻譯自： Web Architecture 101 —

https://medium.com/lumiwallet/the-ultimate-dapp-96c7540383af?source=tag_archive---------87-----------------------,The Ultimate Dapp,"Kyle Lu, founder and CEO of Dapp.com",Lumi Blockchain Wallet,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Lumi Blockchain Wallet Follow Lumi Wallet Blog -- 1 Listen Share And What Developers Think of It How many dapps do you use on a daily basis? Well let us guess! If you’re reading this now, you must be a gamer, a crypto trader, a hodler, or, maybe, just a huge blockchain fan and you must be playing around with one or two dapps. But what about the majority of the world’s population that has neither the desire nor the time to get into all this incredibly complicated and sometimes even shady crypto stuff? Today’s dapp market has one major problem — its final product is not that attractive to the general public and they can’t be bothered to make an effort to start learning from the very beginning. It seems like developers from all over the world got extremely excited about the possibility of creating an entirely new type of product and making a change. Building a dapp is the perfect scenario for a modern tech startup: it’s still yet to be fully explored, serves a good cause, and is potentially very rewarding. There’s just one ‘but’ — average consumers have no idea why they might need these products. That’s why we have what we have now, which is far from mass adoption. According to statistics, the amount of new dapps being released per month at the end of 2018 was the highest ever: 178 in total. However, there’s no talk about the booming demand for what they offer. To be honest, it’s hardly surprising. First of all, we should all take a deep breath, relax, and give it some time. The industry itself has just emerged and it would be unfair to require immediate results. Seriously, it’s only been a couple of years and progress usually takes a lot more. We don’t want to say developers should sit still and wait for the general public to embrace the beauty of dapps, the blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralization on their own, but there’s no reason to panic either. Instead, we should analyze the present issues that stop consumers from giving dapps a go, and concentrate on finding appropriate solutions. Secondly, it might be a good idea to focus on the final product. Have a look at some existing projects, browse through their websites and try to understand what they offer simply by scrolling down the page. Unfortunately, in many cases, you will be left clueless. Very often the project team tries to deliver a ‘unique solution’ for a problem the user simply doesn’t have, and moreover cannot even understand. It is up to developers to educate their potential users at the moment, nobody is going to do that for them. And, of course, automate everything that can be automated. An average user who is unfamiliar with crypto won’t go through the complicated process of buying a random token on an exchange they have just seen for the first time. Cryptocurrency transactions should become invisible and effortless. Your consumers also do not want to know why EOS-based dapps are a lot faster or cooler or more beautiful than Ethereum-based dapps, so there’s no need to waste your time and website main page space to explain this. No need to make a masterpiece out of your whitepaper. The end product that people might want to use is the only thing that matters. Another problem is that the majority of dapps require you to spend some of your hard-earned money right away. Have a look at blockchain games, together with gambling dapps, they are the current industry leaders. You cannot go far in your gameplay without spending some crypto, and only a few games offer some kind of free trial option. On the other hand, we have centralized mobile games that very often are completely free of charge and you might have to pay for some special in-game items or superpowers or other ‘extra’ stuff and it’s completely up to you whether you need it or not. It’s a great deal for everyone — the developer gets users who can play for free and provide valuable feedback and, eventually, some of them will become fans of the game and start putting some real money into it. One should never underestimate the power of a good bargain! And, of course, there are technical issues like scalability, transaction speed, the volatility of crypto, the list is quite long really. But as we said, we just have to give it some time, work on some solutions, and adapt according to the market’s behavior. But who knows more about the dapp business than developers themselves and the projects dedicated to support them? We’ve asked a few of them to share their thoughts, hopes, and concerns. And here’s what came of that. Q1: What are the most important technical problems that dapp developers should solve ASAP? There are 3 of them: 1. Smart contract security; 2. Well-Planned functionality between decentralized and centralized components (smart contracts and server); 3. Efficient data storage. Q2: What kind of dapps would a regular user, not very familiar with crypto, want to use (except for gaming)? Can you name a dapp that stands out and why? Social dapps such as Steem-based dapps. Steemit is the best for beginners to enter the dapp world — account setup is easy, there’s excellent UX, good incentives for users, and a strong community. Q1: What is the best platform for dapp development (Ethereum/EOS/TRON) in existence today? As of 2019, there is a long list of platforms that are in contest for developers. As the whole space is still very young, platforms are all still far from mature. Even if the chain itself runs stably, there is still a huge gap when it comes to standards, services, and infrastructure. Therefore, this question needs to be split into two answers: a) For a developer that builds digital infrastructure, the choice of platform depends mostly on key performance indicators such as speed, cost, capacity, popularity, level of decentralization, etc. The product must fit the chain. A chain with a high level of decentralization might be the right choice of infrastructure around high value financial transactions. A chain with high speed and low transaction costs could be chosen to build the backbone for micro incentive products. As 2019 seems to be essential for all platforms to become more usable, there is a good chance for infrastructure developers to negotiate a financial incentive. b) For dapp developers that create end user products, such as games, the key is to be chain agnostic. The current maturity of the platforms may give indicators as to what consensus type might prevail for certain use cases, but certainly not which chain. Assumed that longevity of the dapp is desired, the foundations need to be built in a dynamic, flexible, and platform independent way as the blockchain world is changing rapidly. Q1: What kind of dapps would a regular user, not very familiar with crypto, want to use (except for gaming)? News. These days we have lots of fake news with Blockchain that can be prevented. Q2: Can you name a dapp that stands out and why? Blockchain Cuties. Game updates are incredibly important. If you take Fortnite, for example, they release new updates regularly to keep the users interested. Blockchain Cuties are doing a great job in that area with lots of in-game updates and collaborations. Q3: What is the best platform for dapp development (Ethereum/EOS/TRON) in existence today? I would choose Tron as Tron is investing the most resources and money into the blockchain gaming industry. Q4: Speaking of your project: what are your lofty objectives? We are not a dapp; Crypto Gamers Community is a well-established Blockchain Gaming Community that strives to build a blockchain gaming environment that embraces honesty, loyalty, and camaraderie above all else. We are dedicated to pushing blockchain gaming towards mass adoption. We work towards growing the best and most engaged gaming and dapp community in the industry. Our goal is to help Blockchain games gain traction and provide them not only much-needed visibility, but also quality connections, advice, and community support. Q5: What is one thing you like about existing dapp games? Various things, including: Decentralized asset exchanges. Verifiable scarcity of virtual objects and collectibles. Fast and secure payment networks, and the ability for developers to properly monetize their creations. Q1: What are the most important technical problems that dapp developers should solve ASAP? User onboarding. Integrated wallets with dapps. Using already establish applications with blockchain integration since there is already a market for these applications. e.g. a sports dapp using Strava. Q2: What kind of dapps would a regular user, not very familiar with crypto, want to use (except for gaming dapps)? Sports tracking. Fitbit pace-tracking rewards. p2p integrated iphone/android games. Easier, simpler, and faster banking and global wire transfers. Q3: Can you name a dapp that stands out and why? Status: easy to use, great community, caters to various needs from dapp incubation, to chat and transfers. CryptoServal for mixing game interaction with charity. Aave — crypto lending made easy. Q4: What is the best platform for dapp development (Ethereum/EOS/TRON) in existence today? ETH/EOS/Steem depending on the different needs and types of dapps to build. Tron I wouldn’t trust for now. Q5: Speaking of your dapp: what is are your lofty objectives? (not very relevant for you, but you can speak of your lofty objectives as well :smirk:) No dapp haha, just want to help grow the dapp ecosystem and appropriate industry usability. I don’t think blockchain is needed for all industries. Q6: What is one thing you like about existing dapp games? EOS Knights — fun and easy to use, lots of levels, pretty much reminds you of good old RPG games except you can make earnings. Q7: Imagine the craziest dapp. How would it look? (assuming that there are no such dapps so far) I’d like to see a dapp that mixes environmental sustainability with finance/identity with energy. The dapp industry has only started gaining momentum. It’s obvious that both creators and supporters are very driven and ready to work on issues together. It is also pleasant to note that the dapp community is pretty reasonable when it comes to establishing a certain growth area and acknowledging weak points. Although things like the ‘ultimate dapp’ can hardly exist because of the variety of approaches and technical issues, the future of the industry looks bright. And let’s be honest: perfect is boring. Of course, there will be a few bumps in the road, but with the right strategy and patience, together we will be able to make a final product users will want to use.

https://medium.com/@officialecholemanagement/untitled-chapter-2-dd455be27cf6?source=tag_archive---------166-----------------------,Untitled (Chapter 2),Written by Echo Le,Echo Le,No Author URL,N/A,7 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Echo Le Follow -- Listen Share Chapter 2: “Alice” “It all happened so quickly” I thought to myself. Not even a year has gone since the passing of my parents that the Lockton name made its’ way on the front cover of all major news outlets again. Only this time, I was included because someone or…something tried to murder me too. “Lockton Estate in Ruins, Jacob Lockton Deceased, Lockton Tragedy, End Of Lockton?” were just some of the headlines. Surveillance from the deployed drones didn’t pick up any sign of life on the property after the explosion. The whole Lockton estate was gone, people tried to savage remains of priceless valuables our family had but found nothing. The only survivors were myself, Mr. Castle, and a trained team of guards including our help staff. We’re all very close since my parents been using the same team of staff for as long as I can remember. Strict background checks and physical training was required for all members of the Lockton Estate. “Ugh.” I grunted as I opened my eyes to a fully air bagged cocoon. A bright rim of light around the protective glass flickered a couple times before it finally turned on. A familiar voice sounded muffled but was pounding on the glass outside while my eyes adjusted to the light, “Mr. Lockton! Mr. Lockton! Are you alright?” was all I heard thanks to the ringing in my ear from the explosion and the drop, but I could tell the person was concern for my well-being. “Is that you Mr. Castle?!” I yelled. “Yes sir! Everyone is alright, we were all waiting for you!” he responded. “In a second! I need to get out of this thing!” I exclaimed. “Computer open.” I demanded. Now, I was staring at a screen with “Username & Password” popped up on it. I stared at the empty boxes wondering what it may be. It was the last thing I was expecting to do after falling half a thousand feet underground. I know mom and dad have told me before, but I was having a difficult time remembering what it was from everything being so sudden. “Use your hand sir!” Mr. Castle yelled still standing outside my cocoon. I couldn’t hear him as I was in one of my deep thoughts thinking about the login. After taking a few short breathes to calm down and think, it finally came to me. The drop reminded me of when we all went skydiving as a family. It was also around the time my parents told me about “The Emergency Bunker”. We had so much fun that day. My parents were so adventurous, and I got teary eyed as I finally realized it was all of our initials with a various number of complicated symbols. I quickly swiped up the on-screen keyboard and tapped on the empty boxes to enter the login. “Incorrect Password! Self-destruct in 60 seconds….59…58…57…” in large red letters and numbers showed on the screen after I typed what I THOUGHT was the login. “NO! WHAT?!” I screamed. Growing frustrated and confused, I just slammed my hand on the screen. “IDENTITY VERIFIED; self-destruct canceled.” showed up. “Welcome Mr. Jacob Preston Lockton” popped up on the screen right after followed by a green light around the edge of the glass. My heart paused for a second. I can’t believe I almost died, AGAIN. “My parents must have not wanted any trespassers down here” I said to Mr. Castle as the glass in front of me turned clear. Words can’t explain how happy I was to see a familiar face, “Computer open.” I demanded again. The glass quickly dissipated like a hologram, almost like it was never there. The muffled was gone and I could hear clearly again. “They didn’t. Your parents were very strict about who they allowed to know about this bunker.” replied Mr. Castle. He then put out his arm, offering me a hand to help me out of my bed cocoon. The bunker itself looked like a giant cement room. Very plain and empty, but it was well lit. I looked at Mr. Castle and said, “Umm there’s nothing here?” “Look again.” Mr. Castle said after stepping on one of the cement squares on the ground. A hologram figure appeared. It was similar to the indestructible glass on my bed cocoon, but the figure had no face or any identifying features. “Hello, Mr. Lockton, my name is Alice, but you probably know me as “computer”. Your parents made me. I am sorry for your lost, I also miss Mr. & Mrs. Lockton greatly, but it’s so nice to officially meet you.” said Alice. “Uhh…Hi Alice? Thank you, can you help me get everyone settled in and check for injuries?” I responded still a little confused but in awe at the same time. “Your wish is my command sir.” Alice responded. The plain and empty giant space started to transform. Bunk beds, tables, and so much more were sliding out of the walls and floor. Everyone just stood there, amazed by what was going on around them. “Oh! Where are my manners? Here you go.” Alice said as a seat popped up behind everyone. “Thank you, Alice.” everyone said with a smile on their face as they watched the space fill with furniture. I looked over to my right and asked Mr. Castle, “How did you know where to step to activate Alice?” He responded, “Well there are many ways you, yourself could’ve activated her Jacob, you just have to say her name,” he continued. “for me however, your parents entrusted me to be your legal guardian if anything ever happened to them a long time ago, so I asked your father to include that special tile specifically for me…that’s why we’re still all here ya’ know? Alice’s main priority is to protect and inform you sir, she would’ve eliminated and got rid of us before even exposing you to this bunker if I didn’t have access to the tile.” he said. “Wow, well thank god you all are here!” I said back with a smile at Mr. Castle. The staffs’ faces went from smiles to being completely terrified after overhearing Mr. Castle response to me. “There’s nothing to be afraid of guys! We’re all family here.” I quickly spurred out, hoping to ensure everyone that they’re fine. “As long as Alice don’t sense a threat to Mr. Lockton, all of us should be perfectly safe down here for a while.” Mr. Castle added. As we sat there watching things pop out of the walls, Alice deployed a drone to scan our bodies for any injuries during the drop. Two of the guards had a sprained ankle which was surprising, given that the staffs’ communal cocoon was completely wrecked during the drop. I felt horrible; all these people were stuck down here because some freakish shadow tried to murder me. Good thing the staffs were all put through intense training, most if not, all of them have some sort of medical, combat, or survival skill. I knew Mr. Castle was ex-military and covert op back in his younger days. It was so heartwarming to see everyone all helping each other out after Alice provided basically everything they needed for their injuries. A brief moment passed, Alice was done setting up the beds and furniture for us, Mr. Castle made a quick meal out of canned spam, tomato sauce, and pasta for everyone. As everyone was finishing up, I proposed a speech… During our meal there were lots of arising questions about what the plan was and when we were going to be able to go back up to the surface. Knowing that everyone down in this bunker with me loves my parents almost as much as I do, loyalty and trust wasn’t a concern for me. I been thinking about what I would say to everyone since the drop. “I would like to start off by thanking each and every one of you for being here. I know and understand this was unexpected and a huge inconvenience for us all. However, we all knew since the day of my parents’ passing, that things weren’t going to be “normal” again. You all are the only “family” I have left. If anyone insist on leaving right now, you can. You’ll be transported to a black site where you will live for five years, afterwards, I’ll have Alice provide you with a new identity, and you can start a new life anywhere you choose. For anyone who’s willing to stay, I look forward to working with you until this threat on the Lockton name is gone. That’s all, good night everyone.” There was a moment of silence after I was done speaking. I looked around the table and I had all these eyes on me. No one moved from their seats. Not even one person. They all started to slowly clap and almost everyone had tears in their eyes. I got emotional as well seeing how much support I had even with my parents gone. In this very moment was when I thought about my parents and thanked them in my mind for being so paranoid because even though we were deep underground, we had Alice.

The college admission process is a juggling act where students must balance the admission process along with academics and extracurricular activities. This time of the year can be stressful and hard to manage for many. High School Students are Considering Questions Such As: Where do I want to enroll? How much and how can I afford school? What do I want to major in? All these questions and many more linger in the minds of these high school students during their last year of high school. This past weekend The American Digital Diversity Initiative partnered with Phi Iota Alpha Fraternity Inc., a Latino-based organization from UC Santa Barbara, to host students from Santa Fe High School in an outreach program. The goal of the outreach program was to assist in answering several of these transitional questions but it was an opportunity to shed light to the AP Computer Science students that participated in the day-long event about how their possible academic endeavors would look like if they were to major in Computer Science. The day was packed with many workshops that stemmed from a financial aid assistance, tech career talk, and an open forum where students were able to ask the brothers about their college experience. Lunch was provided along with a tour of the university, which for most was their first college visit. The day ended with a twist as we provided a coding challenge for the students to accomplish. It was an opportunity for the students to see one of the computer labs the university provided, in addition, it also helps with prepping them with their later exams in the year. Overall the event with Phi Iota Alpha Fraternity Inc. was a success. These opportunities to bring awareness and provide resources for underrepresented students continues to be at the forefront.

https://medium.com/@dianaderose/building-a-great-sdk-2-99bbf8e8372b?source=tag_archive---------47-----------------------,Building a great SDK — Part 2,Written by Diana De Rose,Diana De Rose,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Diana De Rose Follow -- Listen Share Earlier today, I published a piece on Building a great SDK and wanted to follow up with few more tips and guidelines towards building an awesome SDK. In my last post, I listed the core components that an SDK should contain. The following section captures guidelines and best practices for all essential modules in an SDK. While it can seem like a big list of TODO’s, use this as a reference to build a checklist of your own. Open-source: SDKs should be open sourced and added to a public facing github repo. This increases transparency as well as encourages contribution from the developer community. Naming conventions and Coding standards: Follow language specific coding standards and guidelines. However, for key components make sure the ClassNames and core features are consistent across an SDK in multiple languages. While naming classes, make sure they are meaningful and avoid exposing internal abbreviations. Packages: Make sure all classes are organized under packages with meaningful names. For example, service classes can be added under service package, auth related classes can be under oauth package, model classes under data package and so on. Class Methods and parameters: While most Swagger generated SDKs provide an API class for each endpoint, this doesn’t add much value to developers as they need to keep track of each API endpoint to class mapping. If the API supports basic CRUD operations across all entities then create one single Service class and provide generic methods for each of the operations. Example- The service class can be prefixed with meaningful information such as PaymentService, AccountingService etc. There can be an exception to the above rule if the API has different operations for each entity; in which case, separate Service classes can be created for each entity. However, make sure to put any common logic into a Base class. Comments: Comments increase readability of your code and eases maintenance. Add class level as well as method levels comments to document the class and method in a clear and concise manner. In addition, comments should be added wherever necessary to explain any complex flow. Language Version: Before creating an SDK, gather data on the most widely used versions of the language for which the SDK is being created. An SDK should cater to the widest audience, as well as be extensible to future developers in the platform. External dependencies: Avoid adding too many external libraries to an SDK. This causes tight coupling between the library and the SDK and can create issues when the library is deprecated, not maintained or has vulnerabilities. In cases where using an external library is a must, make sure to use a library that is widely used and doesn’t contain any security vulnerability. Use tools like Renovate or OWASP dependency check to scan for vulnerabilities. Default values: Make sure that an SDK always has default values set for all parameters that are essential for making an API call so that the developer is not forced to supply values for each and every config parameter. Testing: Test cases are an important part of the SDK and should be added before shipping the SDK. Documentation: Documentation of the SDK should contain links to the artifacts, start up guides, limitations, definitions, and any other offerings that would help building functions that leverage the API. Document the getting started guide such that a new developer is able to start using it in 5–10 minutes. In addition to the readme, make sure to include the following: Release process: Before releasing a new version of the SDK, make sure to run regression tests with the new changes and update the version number of the SDK. Versioning the SDK: Once the initial version of an SDK is released, subsequent updates to it should be made by updating the major or minor version of the SDK. As a best practice, major version should be incremented when key features or components are added to the SDK while minor version should be incremented for bug fixes and minor enhancements. Auto Generation of the SDK: — While SDKs can be auto generated using swagger and other public tools, often such SDKs don’t add much value to developers. Refrain from producing such SDKs unless it is a business need. Even in such instances, make sure to customize the SDK to provide additional value rather than shipping the SDK as-is. Core components of the SDK can however be automated; for instance, you can automate such that changes to the schema automatically generate new classes for your model component. Statelessness: An SDK should be a stateless component and should not work as a mechanism to store and maintain client data. If functions are added in an SDK that change the state of data, care should be taken to ensure the client is made aware. Example: an SDK should not auto refresh tokens without notifying the developer (client code); neither should an SDK be used for storing and managing the latest copy of tokens. Tokens are sensitive data and should be stored securely in the developer’s (client) database. Extensibility: an SDK should be designed such that it is easily extensible to include new features, components, as well as support new version of the language that it is built in. Any time a new feature is added to the SDK, make sure it is backward compatible. Note: While adding features that cater to one-off requests, build them as extensions rather than core features. Validation: An SDK should not handle API validation and should pass the API request to the service layer as-is. This will enable the API to modify validations without impacting the SDK. An SDK should, however, validate that key variables (such as tokens, environment name, and client id) that are required to make an API call are provided. Maintaining the SDK: Once the SDK is released, make sure to maintain the SDK and engage with the community. Everything mentioned up until here are the bare minimum essentials in a good SDK. In addition to providing a wrapper around the APIs, an SDK should also consider adding an orchestration layer which can perform multiple operations under the hood. This can be done for common use cases that developers are likely to use. For example: In the accounting world, a common orchestration use case would be to create an invoice and billing time activity for the employee who performed the job or capturing a payment and creating a sales receipt for the payment. Other great value adds can be adding a retry mechanism in the event of a failure, async operations, pagination support to query data in chunks and others. Although a lot of the examples above pertain to the Accounting world, these can be used in pretty much any context.

I care about planet earth. We only get one chance to live on the planet that I know of so I want Her taken care of. It bothers me when I see people litter, spit and just don’t give a damn about our Mother Earth. We can do better. 2. I can’t do everything alone, although I would like to sometimes. I may have my personal opinions about people, but at the end of the day we need each other so I put aside my petty differences and try to put my feet in the other person’s shoes thus I try to get along with everyone. 3. I love wild animals although I don’t have any pets. It bugs me that animals are locked up in a prison called a zoo! Let them ALL FREE! I feel like every bug, plant, animal, man and woman are all connected by the dirt we walk on everyday and should be free to live life as they wish. 4. I believe in a Higher Source as man did not create himself. I don’t believe a man crawled out of the water. What was one finger doing while the rest of the hand was in the ocean? 5. Children are special. I don’t have any but when I see the little ones I just coo because they truly are innocent and beautiful. One day I hope to inspire thousands of them…maybe millions. Ok I’m reaching… 6. The criminal justice system is not fair! One day I asked a client who was a Pubic Defender in downtown Los Angeles for 30 years, how many good judges does she know and she said “I can count them on one hand.” I was like what?? That means some people really are innocent and others really are guilty. That’s not fair! 7. I question everything even the very earth we live on. I don’t believe much of what scientists say especially the one’s that think we “exploded into existence” thus I feel the reality we live in somebody created outside of this earth. Based on plenty of photo evidence I don’t believe Buzz and the crew landed on the moon. Too many flaws… 8. I think family is important although I don’t have any here in Los Angeles except for my spouse. I am in a same gender relationship for 12 years and never thought I would be committed to another person so long. I am blessed and I love her. 9.

Innovations from artificial intelligence to blockchain tech, however, offer ways to jumpstart the fintech industry. Major strides in finance technology have helped streamline processes and increase financial literacy. Fintech firms have a unique opportunity to capitalize on the demand for more responsive, user-friendly finance. We’ve decided to update this post (originally published October 2018) to see how these trends have unfolded. Let’s take a look at eight trends taking over the sector in 2019.",Sarah Lang,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sarah Lang Follow Espeo Software -- Listen Share Check out what actually is still relevant for fintech in 2019 Among the many fintech trends, AI voice-operated assistant services increasingly vital parts of many payments apps. Banks and other services are starting to roll out AI customer service chatbots. Rather than wait and talk to a human, you’re likely going to talk to an increasingly sophisticated AI chatbot. Able to process language and predict questions, these systems have made huge strides. Of course, chatbots have been around for over a decade now, but advances in the way AI chatbots analyze large pools of unstructured data has made these tools far more effective. IBM’s Watson Assistant, for instance, leverages a client’s chat history to predict and intelligently direct clients to answers, or to human service reps, if necessary. Improved customer satisfaction boosts sales and better AI chatbots are both improving customer service while also cutting down on redundant labor costs. PwC reports that voice banking will save the industry $3 billion annually. Better, more responsive chatbots can help bring these changes to consumers. AI chatbots have already begun replacing tellers and customer service lines to resolve client tickets more efficiently and at a fraction of the cost. Last year Singapore’s OCBC Bank partnered with Google to launch the first AI-powered voice banking platform. The technology permits customers to chat about bank services which include calculating loan interests, planning future savings, receiving the latest finance market updates and searching for nearby ATMs. Chatbots have also gained popularity by allowing customers to conveniently talk with robots in real time and get accurate answers or detect fraud based on learned customer behavior. AI chatbots help banks reach more customers when and where they want to bank. This not only increases customer satisfaction but also helps firms retain users. AI chatbots help keep costs down and keep customers happy. As one of several fintech trends, this is by far the most widespread currently. Just as AI chatbots have helped cut labor costs, many of the latest banks are launching as digital-only. Fintech applications are replacing more and more brick and mortar bank branches. Once an unthinkable move, this trend indicates that the newest generation of banking customers trust mobile applications to do banking tasks. Digital-only banks are now gaining popularity among millennials as they can receive services in the comfort of their homes or offices, and no longer have to visit banks, now they can perform vital tasks on the website or app. The Financial Brand reports that visits to bank branches will decline by 36 percent between 2017 and 2022. Furthermore, desktop banking will also suffer considerably while mobile transactions will grow 121 percent in the same period. Millennials are much more open to fintech trends. They’re more likely to trust and use a mobile device to bank remotely than previous generations. One current example is the digital bank Revolut, a finance app that enables straightforward cross-border payments. An increasingly mobile workforce will only continue to demand more responsive financial services. Revolut users control their finances at the tip of their fingers through the app. One of its most compelling features is its low rates for currency exchange and features that allow you to pay abroad in your home currency without the fees of traditional payments providers. As of 2019, Revolut has more than 2 million users and gets between 6,000 and 8,000 new customers every day. In addition to Revolut, it’s impossible to talk about mobile banking trends without mentioning Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency payments system. The social media company is entering the payments ecosystem promising to drive broad cryptocurrency adoption. While it’s still a ways off before Libra goes active, the profound implications for the fintech sector are huge. Tapping into the billions of users — many of whom are unbanked could bring many more consumers into the banking fold. Libra will function as both a currency and as a digital wallet — potentially allowing consumers in the developing world to bypass brick and mortar banks altogether. This, of course, is only possible because of the widespread use of mobile devices — , especially in the developing world. A savvy fintech startup would do well to build a mobile payments system. Cashless payments are starting to take over the finance space. With the waves of smartphone use as well as better internet connection consumers in the developing world are increasingly choosing digital payments over cash. Government efforts to reduce fraud and shore up tax revenue are also motivations. India’s Narendra Modhi infamously banned large denomination bills in 2016 to cut down on fraud. The unpopular measure, however, seems to be driving broader adoption of digital payments systems in India. Sweden and other Scandinavian countries are also floating efforts to reduce cash circulation. The European Parliament has taken it a much higher, by launching a second payment service directive which authorizes all businesses to use alternatives to banks. In addition, the directive gives access to any third-party payment solutions to accounts that are hosted by banks. Along with the good fintech trends, there are also some drawbacks. Cyber attacks and other security threats pose unique challenges to the emergent tech. Developers and security specialists have to be creative in the current market to protect consumers from theft. As mentioned earlier, AI chatbots are one line of defense as their machine learning algorithms improve fraud detection. Biometric technology is another emerging trend fintech firms are incorporating into their security features. Iris scans, facial recognition, and fingerprint scanners are among the most popular biometric indicators. Voice activation is also a major trend. Not only is biometric tech safer, but it’s also faster and more pleasant for end users. You no longer need to remember passwords go through several steps to reset. It also means that no one else can access an account. earlier this month, Bahraini Ithmaar Bank unveiled a network of biometric ATMs using customer fingerprints. These types of security measures using unique physical identifiers will only increase the effectiveness of fintech applications. One of the many technologies vying for a spot among fintech trends is blockchain. Distributed ledger tech — the underlying system that powers cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum aim to change monetary transactions and the financial sector dramatically. Blockchain has been taking over the traditional banking system slowly over time. Why? One of the reasons is the reduction of paperwork as it updates the digital ledger in real-time while storing all records in a highly tamper-resistant ledger. Fees to transfer funds across borders are some of the most competitive, but adoption remains slow due to cumbersome UX. Facebook’s Libra appears promising, though competing visions of the level of decentralization and how the network should commit new data remains a major hurdle. Developments in blockchain payments are likely to continue, though as a key component of more centralized systems. Grand visions of decentralized finance and peer-to-peer lending are still distant. However, banks or other fintech platforms would do well to incorporate key aspects of blockchain technology in their services — especially frictionless cross border payments. Change is inevitable. In the financial sector, keeping ahead of the fintech trends is essential to stay relevant in the market. As pressure builds on big banks to innovate, and start-ups continue to attract new customers, new features that make the banking experience better and more responsive are vital. From AI chatbots that can predict questions to digital wallets in increasingly cashless societies, 2019 is an exciting time in fintech. As firms roll out new mobile apps to address major pain points, the entire ecosystem will continue to adapt.

My name is John Bura, and I’ve been coding since 1997. My first coding course was making games in Pascal at my local university. This was my first foray into learning programming. The next year I started learning Visual Basic and C++ as well. I was hooked. In the 90s, it was difficult to make a game. It wasn’t until the 2000s that you got a program like GameMaker that it became easier. But even still, you couldn’t export your game or make anything useful with GameMaker. GameMaker today is a different story, but in the past it wasn’t as good. Even 10 or 11 years ago, Unity was in its infancy, and other engines weren’t as good. So game engines have come a long way. It begs the question: which is the best one? This is a loaded question because a lot of times when it comes down to the best engine, it comes down to personal preference. But I’ve been using Construct 2 and Construct 3 for years, and I absolutely love it. Before that, I tried Unity, Unreal, and other engines, but I always come back to Construct 3. Why? Because it’s extremely easy to make games in Construct 3. I’ve been making games for so long that when I say it’s easy, it’s so easy. My first published game was for the Xbox 360. It was called Circa, and I made it from scratch using C# and XNA at the time. It was so difficult at times that I would make my game on the PC and port it to the Xbox, and because Xbox used a different framework, the game would crash or have a lot of errors. One time I had 50 or so errors and it only kept increasing. I said okay, I’ll port it to the Xbox. But when I ported for Xbox, there were even more errors, about 120. Making games in the past was hard, and this wasn’t even ten years ago where I had all these issues. Today with Unity, Unreal and other engines, it’s a lot easier. One of the things I love about Construct 3 is that it’s so easy. If I wanted to make a simple space shooter, it would take me far less time than any other engine out there. The reason is that it’s a non-coding engine. When I first started my company, a lot of people didn’t like the non-coding aspect of my game development tutorials. Before Construct, I used GameSalad, also a non-coding language to make iOS games. I made 30 iOS games with GameSalad. There are other engines like Stencyl that make games without coding. But when Construct 3 came out, it was so much easier to make games. GameSalad and Stencyl are pretty good engines; but I prefer Construct 3. The workflow is easy to understand and intuitive. The whole program is intuitive. When it comes to making software, not just games, I try to find the path of least resistance. Software development is so hard that you don’t need more factors to make it difficult. So when you have a game engine that gives a lot of errors, perhaps that game engine is too difficult for you as a programmer. Many engines are complex. To make a game work, it’s complex, and many processes happening in the backend. Naturally there will be some issues. But at the same time, you should get your idea out as fast as you can. Remember, your idea is useless if it’s sitting on your hard drive or the cloud. You want your game to be played and enjoyed by as many people as possible. After GameSalad, after Construct 2 came out you still had to download it to your computer and it was only available for the PC. I had a PC and Mac for different development. I loved Construct and wished there was a Mac version. Construct 2 was a downloadable PC product, but Construct 3 is available to be used in the browser. This is incredible. You can build iOS and Android games in the browser. You just open up Chrome, go to editor.Construct.net, and you’re there. That’s it. No installation necessary. It’s awesome. I’ve made several games in Construct that I’ve made in my browser. You can do this on Chromebook, a Mac, and a PC, anywhere where Chrome is available. On top of that, you can save all your games to Cloud. Whenever I make a game, I download it to my computer, and upload it to the Cloud. There are different clouds you can upload to. I upload to them all because when i’m at home I use a different computer from work. Having everything work on chrome is amazing. This is a bigger philosophical question regarding development: Should everything be done on the web, or should we be using native code? We’ll talk about that in another article. For now, we’ll look at more features I absolutely love about Construct. Construct is not that versatile, and making big games is challenging. If making a big game, Construct is not the best engine for you. If you’re making a big game with multiplayer, I would use Unity or Unreal. But for the most part, many 2d games can be made in Construct. Construct is a 2D engine; if you want to make a 3D game, yo’ll have to use something else. More on that later. I’ve rarely been hindered by the toolset Construct offers. Construct is intuitive and the tools they provide, you can do whatever you want with them. It’s rare that I think, I wish this could be done in Construct and it can’t. Sometimes in Construct there are easy and challenging things to do. The functionality in Construct might mean what you need to do requires extra code. This is true for every kind of game engine. Because Construct is so easy, many people think that if you can’t do something immediately, it can’t be done at all. This is far from the truth. I’ve fallen on this boat as well where I’ve had a problem and it took extra time to solve it in a less intuitive way. It didn’t mean I couldn’t do it, it was just harder to do. I say this after years and years of coding, I can’t stress how easy it is to make and prototype a game in Construct. When it comes to designing a game graphically, Construct 3 has a built-in pixel editor that is almost as good as other commercial editors out there. It needs more features to be the best, but you can still do any kind of pixel art in your game and again in the browser. If you want to pull in your own art from Adobe Illustrator, for example, you can simply drop it in. So, how is the community, and is there a lot of examples of code? The good thing about Construct 2 and Construct 3 is a lot of the code is similar. Construct 3 is a much better engine than Construct 2. But at the same time, a lot of the examples if you need to find out how to do something, you can Google the question and use one for Construct 2 for Construct 3. If you follow other languages, sometimes going from 2.9 and 3.0 has a huge difference. With Construct 2 and Construct 3, at least the code base is relatively similar. Of course there are differences, but Construct 3 usually is an improvement. Another thing I love about Construct 3 is they release a new version every week. There is a Release Version (a stable version) which means there are few if any bugs in it. There is also a Beta Version which means you can try the newest features before the Beta becomes stable. I love getting emails from Team Scirra because it shows the team is dedicated. It’s a small team, but I’ve talked to them many times and they are very committed to development. The development they do is paramount to what million dollar companies do. What happens if you want to do something for a game but there is no way to do it in Construct? There you can make your own plugins and behaviors. There is a development kit out there that will allow you to do this. That means there is no limit to what you can do. If there’s one feature that I love the most about Construct: the mobile preview feature. This is amazing. If you’ve ever developed for mobile devices,you know that you have to pull up a simulator and even getting that to work is challenging. And why would you want to test on a real mobile device? Well, when you get something to work on your mobile device, it might not work in other ways. You might be making your game on your computer and as soon as you test it on your mobile app, it doesn’t work. One of the biggest faux pas I made was not testing my mobile game on device. Thus my game was released without music. This was a big mistake. I assumed what I saw on the computer would be what would happen on the phone. Don’t make my mistake. Always test on a mobile device. How does Construct deal with testing on mobile? Does it use simulators or extraneous functionality? No! You take a picture of a QR code, and your game pops up on your phone for you to test. This is the most elegant and minimalist solution I have seen after years of being a developer that makes testing on a device easy. If you’re tried to build for multiple devices like iPhones and tablets using Android Studio or Xcode, it would take you ten times longer to test for each device. I’ve used Construct 3 to make commercial games. But there are a few things I would like to see. In Construct, your game is exported into a web app or used in an HTML wrapper. This means it’s basically like a website. Technically, you can release for iOS, Android, and Xbox, but if there’s no web support, you can’t release for it. For example, the Apple TV doesn’t support web apps. It’s true that there is a project on Github that will let you run a website on the Apple TV, but Apple officially doesn’t want web apps on the Apple TV. That means the HTML5 game you export from Construct can’t go on the Apple TV. The main issue with exporting for HTML5 is some platforms don’t support it, like the Apple TV. If web support was universal across all platforms, exporting a Construct 3 game for your chosen platform would be easier. For Construct 3, you’re at the mercy of the device’s support for web content. The only way to solve this is to have native exporters. The founders have been clear they don’t want to add this. And for good reason: it would require time, a large team and be costly. The team would rather make Construct 3 a better experience than work on a native exporter. However it would be nice to have. The other thing I would like to make in Construct 3 with its engine is a 3D games. I don’t think making 3d games is on the roadmap for Scirra (Construct’s team.) The problem is, transitioning from 2D to 3D isn’t just adding another dimension. The team would have to do a lot of work to get games to look good and work well. The extra dimension is hard to implement into an engine. If you’ve been using engines for a long time, you know the ongoing Unreal vs Unity “Which engine looks better?” debate. It’s only been recently that Unity has been able to catch up to Unreal. Rendering and making games look good in the 3D space is challenging. Construct could go a different road. Instead of making games look hyper realistic like Unity and Unreal are oding, Construct could adopt a cartoon-style. I like making 2D games because they’re easy to make. But 3D games offer so much more versatility. Also, models being made for 3D are harder to do unless you’re making voxel. Even then it can be challenging. If you really want to make a 3D game, Construct is not the engine for you. Construct 3 is an amazing engine, and you should try it now. I’ve been using Construct 2 since 2011, and I love the engine. This review has been long overdue. So if you like making games, check it out on editor.Construct.net.

Mobile Applications have become a significant part of every individual’s lifestyle around the globe. People across all geographies are currently performing various tasks through apps, be it entertainment, online shopping, information, search and browse, bill payments and much more. It is required by businesses to enhance customer experience over mobile for better branding and revenue generation. Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are an advanced step towards this innovation. In other word, PWA is websites with the look and feel of a mobile app. A Growing Marketplace for PWA The essential center components for each business are the maintenance of the existing client base and connecting with the potential clients. Higher transformation rates guarantee that the income age stream stays stable later on. Nonetheless, according to distributed sources, it has been seen that a site loses 7% of its transformation rate with the 100-millisecond delay in stacking. The higher holdup time has a negative impact on client consideration. It is a noteworthy difficulty towards brand acknowledgment that fundamentally impacts business development. Progressive Web Apps are a helpful way to deal with diminishing this downbeat sway. PWA applications are quicker to stack that guide in catching client consideration in the correct substance. There is no download or establishment required for PWAs. Henceforth, it contributes decidedly to boosting change rates. Aside from this, among other ongoing improvements, Google as of late declared that page speed will be considered as a pursuit positioning parameter. With this advancement, it tends not out of the ordinary that the tendency towards the selection of PWAs will ascend at an unfaltering pace. What is a Progressive Web App? Progressive Web Apps are new age web applications which are described by standard loadings like that of any site or website page however with certain extra functionalities. They can work disconnected and pop-up messages alongside gadget equipment get to. The last one is essentially accessible just to local applications. Consequently, dynamic web applications are a blend of the best of the two stages. It offers the adaptability of a web with an upgraded involvement of local applications. Therefore, it is the propelled instrument of client experience. The clients get a versatile application like feel through the programs. Progressive Web App Benefits After a knowledge into what is a dynamic web application, it is fundamental to comprehend the utility of the equivalent. Dynamic web application benefits are both specialized and business-driven in nature. • PWA applications are both littler in size which makes them speedier to stack. Notwithstanding that, there is no prerequisite for establishment too. This aide in opening up the telephone memory. • Another eye-getting highlight of PWA applications is disconnected usefulness. In this manner, these can be utilized without a web association and does not eat upon the information. This essentially adds to the client experience. • Push Notifications have turned out to be one of the powerful instruments for producing interests among clients. Up to this point, this element was confined to local applications as it were. PWA applications give this component too. • For the situation of local applications, there is a consistent prerequisite for refreshing. Manual updates are dreary and refresh through portable information result in an abnormal state of information utilization. PWA applications are free from such problems. • These applications are instrumental in expanding SEO remainder and openness. Since PWA applications load quicker, they get a seeking positioning supporter. • Lastly, they can be valuable towards broad market outreach, hence profiting the brand acknowledgment factor. Progressive Web App Limitations While there are numerous noteworthy advantages, then again, there are sure dynamic web application restrictions moreover. • As it is new innovation development, dynamic web highlight option to the web applications requires an extra time span. There is an absence of institutionalization too for this situation. • There is no finished access to the gadget equipment in the event of PWA applications. Not at all like local applications, full access is still not set up. • For the situation of late internet browsers, the help is estimable.

By this stage, an organisation will have built a full picture of its operations and services; examined the applications it uses and assessed the full suite of data at its fingertips. Now it is time to think about how digital transformation will be delivered technologically. The technology that underpins a business needs to be designed in a way that enables the technical environment to facilitate new digital initiatives and services. Organisations must consider if and where they can modernise legacy systems to support their digital transformation. It is not always necessary to start building out new digital solutions. The adaptation of existing systems can prove effective and is a cost-effective way of embarking on the journey. Many organisations may currently use large-scale enterprise solutions for core line of business systems like HR, Finance, etc. To ensure these can be included in the transformation journey, organisations must consider how digital solutions will integrate with these key systems. How should organisations build out and adapt their enterprise architecture to support digital transformation? The architecture must provide a platform that simplifies the development of digital services. Most organisations will be coming from the traditional starting point of on-premise architecture, which will work well if it is managed and planned to support the changes that digital transformation brings. However, many organisations are moving to the cloud due to its affordability and flexibility. The cloud ensures activities are seamless, secure, scalable and reliable. It supports iterative development and makes adding new components easy. It simplifies advanced analytics, efficiently retrieving data from multiple sources and enriching it to provide valuable insight. Finally, it is a cost-effective and efficient way of developing new services, products and solutions — vital in today’s rapidly evolving and competitive digital marketplace. Neueda will work with you to understand where you are on your journey and what the best fit is for you. An example of this approach is a project we completed with one of our customers in the Energy and Utilities sector. Rapid changes in the energy sector inspired the company to develop services to support new consumer capabilities and demands. They sought digital solutions that would enhance their services whilst integrating with their existing IT systems. We worked in partnership with the customer to understand the potential digital services and what a single platform to support these might look like. Within three months we delivered a cloud-based platform, using Microsoft Azure, designed to support and integrate with existing IT systems, simplify the testing and development of new digital services and improve data analytics from a wide range of sources. The project has future-proofed our customer by empowering them to drive a pipeline of new, modern, digitally-led products and services in an ever-evolving, competitive marketplace.

Have a spare few seconds? Check your email again. See if the news headlines have changed in the last 10 minutes. Maybe Boris Johnson has cleaned his car. Our brains find digital devices addictive because they give us the sensation of doing something for almost zero effort. We can ‘visit’ remote places in a fraction of a second by swiping and tapping one finger. As a species we have evolved over millions of years to survive in our physical environment by concerving energy and resources. Getting something for nothing is addictive, it tastes like sugar! It doesn’t matter how hard you try, next time you pick up your phone you’ll find yourself browsing Instagram or looking at flowerpots on Amazon before you even realise it. I was thinking about this and wondered if there was a way to change the balance of the equation. What if I associated some physical effort with using my iPhone. Could this help fight the addiction? So I devised the Flamingo experiment. It goes like this: You can only use your smartphone standing on one leg. It sounds silly but I’m not joking. The beauty of this technique is that it’s very simple and clear. You don’t need to add up your screentime minutes. Or agonise about when you should turn your phone off (what if the plumber calls me back and I don’t answer?). You don’t need to try harder. The method just associates a physical effort with using your digital device. And for me it has been pretty effective. My screentime minutes are down massively. I am still connected. I still receive notifications and can answer important emails promptly. But checking my emails doesn’t accidentally lead to browsing FaceBook, because my brain is telling me that my leg is tired. (And also maybe I’m a bit worried about looking stupid standing on one leg in the street). If you’re fighting digital screen addiction yourself I strongly recommend you give this a go. Maybe choose a day when you’re not at work and you’re trying to have a day off. Set a rule that you can have your smartphone but can’t use it unless you are standing on one leg. Or maybe find a different physical penalty—Tadasana (Mountain Pose) in Yoga could be a good one to try, and might look slightly less silly. Let me know in the comments how you get on!

Your brain uses up to 20 percent of all the calories you consume each day. Maybe that explains why we’ve readily accepted that computers will use a huge amount of energy in processing, and emit so much heat that they also create a secondary power need to cool them down? We are becoming increasingly aware of the amount of energy the data centres supporting our favourite social media sites, film & music streaming services and online shopping are using, and are expected to use in the future: Last year, data centres worldwide used an estimated 200 terawatt hours (TWh), which is more than the national energy consumption of some countries, and accounts for approximately 1% of global electricity demand. The data centres’ thirst for electric power is predicted to rise rapidly within the coming years, particularly if computationally intensive cryptocurrency mining continues to grow. This could potentially make a big contribution to global carbon emissions, since only approximately 20% of the electricity used by data centres comes from renewable sources, according to Greenpeace. However, some 20 Internet companies, including big players, such as Facebook, Apple and Google have committed to using 100% renewable energy. Some plan to build renewable power plants near their data centres, but in most cases, they are buying electricity from a grid provider. Google is now the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy on the planet. There are some interesting implications to the fact that data centres are gobbling up the renewable energy produced in countries like Ireland, which the Guardian newspaper explored in a great article from 2017. Pessimistic models predict that electricity use by data centres could rise to approximately 8% of the global total by 2030. More moderate estimates say that, although their requirements will increase, efficiency gains will offset them. Let’s consider those. Efficiency improvements are possible. Hyperscale data centres are ultra-efficient and use computing architecture designed for scalability (up to hundreds of thousands of servers). The power usage efficiency (PUE) of a data centre is defined as the total energy needed to run it, including lights and cooling, divided by the compute energy used. Traditional data centres typically have a PUE of about 2.0, while hyperscale facilities have been trimmed to about 1.2 by eliminating unnecessary energy sinks (no video monitors, no flashing lights) and building to a purely fit-for-purpose design. Hyperscale data centres currently number around 400 and account for one fifth of the world’s data centre electricity usage, but within a few years, estimates are that hyperscale centres will step up the pace of replacing traditional data centres and account for almost half of consumption according to an International Energy Agency report. Hyperscalers have also reduced their PUE by improving cooling. In a traditional data centre, air conditioning accounts for approximately 40% of the energy bill (and uses billions of litres of water). By eliminating the need for compression chillers and cooling towers there are environmental gains in both energy and water consumption. One way to do this is to use colder locations for data centres (hello Scandinavia and Iceland) and blow the cool outside air into them. Other approaches include piped water, which allows data centres to be located anywhere and cooled using warm water. At a recent summit I attended, there was an interesting discussion about immersing servers in a cooling liquid. Along with better cooling is the more efficient reuse of any heat produced by the data centre, for example, to warm neighbouring buildings but, because heat doesn’t travel well, this only works when data centres can be placed near any recipients for their heat. Alternative approaches are to convert the excess heat into electricity or use it to power cooling systems that can, in turn, be used to keep data centres cool. Although our brains use 20% of our calorific intake, they are comparatively far more efficient than computers COUs. Perhaps it’s time to accept a need to redefine the computer itself to cut energy use, by moving beyond silicon? Besides quantum computing and hybrid models, there are some way-out ideas such as reaction chemical computing, DNA computing, reservoir computing and the use of slime mould (which is verging on the recent series of Star Trek!). Other approaches are to simulate the neurons of animal brains (neuromorphic computing) which is being trialled by IBM and Qualcomm and may be particularly successful for aspects of AI such as pattern recognition. That’s the subject of a future article, which I’m looking forward to writing soon! Please let me know your thoughts in the responses. Are we headed for a future without silicon? Where are the possible energy savings? Should we reconsider our need for massive data centres? -- -- 1 Elijah McClain, George Floyd, Eric Garner, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Michael Brown, Oscar Grant, Atatiana Jefferson, Tamir Rice, Bettie Jones, Botham Jean Technical content creator writing about data science and software.

We remember them as great innovators, but their creations were also products of the social forces of their time. The telephone proliferated for the same reasons as the telegraph preceding it, and Ford’s factories were steeped in the production incentives of rising consumerism and the Industrial Revolution. Viewing the process of innovation as something shaped by institutions rather than as the actions of inspired individuals is an idea known as the Social Construction of Technology (SCOT). The sociological lens is capable of providing explanations where the conventional narrative of brilliant inventors and serendipity falls short. Inventors are human individuals, and individual motives such as curiosity and convenience are sometimes inadequate in comparison to external pressures such as patriotism and competition. After all, for what purpose other than total warfare would anyone have built a nuclear bomb? “If I had foreseen Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I would have torn up my formula in 1905.” — Albert Einstein Let’s enter history at a point in time fourteen years after Einstein’s death in 1955. It is 1969, and there are men on the moon. They are white, American men, but they are there because black women ran computations for NASA, because the Soviets punted Sputnik into orbit, because Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan spurred the development of the atomic bomb, because Isaac Newton and an apple invented calculus, because humankind’s first hobby was astronomy. They are all of us, and they are there, stepping out into a landscape previously untouched by life. This grand achievement of human ingenuity, a bootprint on the moon, provides a sense of unity because it ultimately belongs to us all. A girl in her junior year of high school is glued to the television screen as Neil Armstrong utters his immortal words, and she marvels that the broadcast is like science fiction come to life. It seems to her that anything at all must be possible: a cure for cancer, the end of poverty, world peace. Technology is a force for the betterment of society. Human innovation has planted a flag on the moon — what miracles will it have wrought tomorrow? It is 1969, and the American Dream is by now intertwined with the concept of technological progress. In the United States, the post-Hiroshima terror of what paradigm shifts technology can enable has been thoroughly distilled into optimism. Children want to be astronauts. We will have cities on Mars and nuclear-powered flying cars. The science is blinding; therefore the future is bright. “This revelation of the secrets of nature, long mercifully withheld from man, should arouse the most solemn reflections in the mind and conscience of every human being capable of comprehension.” — Winston Churchill, 1945 Throughout the remainder of the 20th century and into the aughts of the new millennium, popular faith in the fundamental benevolence of technological advancement persists. Personal computers and cell phones become widespread and indispensable tools. Out of the thicket of the ’90s sprout the fledgling giants, Google and Amazon. Dial-up dies as nature intended. Smartphones are a camera, computer, GPS, music player, and gaming device all in one — we are instantly besotted. It is 2013, the year of Edward Snowden. Suspicions and conspiracy theories crystallize into hard truth as suddenly the world is made aware that the U.S. government engages in massive data collection. Federal agencies are spying on private citizens at an unprecedented scale made possible only through modern technology. As Snowden tells John Oliver later, his reason for giving classified documents to journalists is so that the public can have an important conversation about the limits of acceptability when it comes to government surveillance and who has access to our personal data. The degree of Snowden’s influence on the discourse about data collection — by actors national, corporate, and otherwise — will be a matter for future historians. It’s already certain, however, that his revelations help inculcate in the public consciousness the sense that the depth of technology’s reach into individual lives is not necessarily determined by the consent of the people. Post-Snowden, Americans know that the wannabe surveillance state exists not only outside of China but as a function of American intelligence agencies, and this cannot become unknown. The genie does not go back into the bottle. As the development of Project Manhattan made it forever possible for other nuclear bombs to follow, so too does the existence of even one mass data collection program instill reasonable doubt that we can ever be made free of its ilk ever again. It is 2013, and Big Brother is watching. “In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.” — J. Robert Oppenheimer In the next several years, advances in AI become increasingly visible. After its heady debut in 2015, DeepMind’s AlphaGo program in 2017 defeats Ke Jie, who at the time was world champion of the oldest and most complex game ever devised. Google makes waves in 2018 when it presents a virtual assistant capable of passing the Turing test while setting up appointments on the user’s behalf. Throughout the 2010s, the meteoric rise of Bitcoin and other crypto unicorns — whose wild, addict-like upswings and crashes seem practically a feature, not a bug — prompt discussions about digital currency regulation and what the future of money may look like. Talks of ideological echo chambers, election interference through targeted advertising, and misinformation online enter the national conversation in 2016, and these topics put down roots. Facebook, after years of controversy over its privacy practices and shadow profiles, is rocked by scandal as its business with Cambridge Analytica is made public. What becomes clear is threefold: technological progress has incredible momentum, progress is a double-edged sword, and progress is an arms race. The need to keep pace with global innovation, fear of missing out on the Next Big Thing, and that Valley-classic ethos to “move fast and break things” — these are all contributing factors to the tech industry’s pursuit of disruption. Ultimately, these pressures all spring from the same fact: there is no status quo. Innovation is survival. If you do not disrupt, then you are, inevitably, disrupted. “I made one great mistake in my life — when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made. But there was some justification — the danger that the Germans would make them.” — Albert Einstein It is 2019. Facebook plans to launch a cryptocurrency. Every new feature that Tesla adds to its Autopilot system makes headlines. Boston Dynamics continues to go viral with each YouTube upload — the channel’s comment sections are rife with both glib salutations to our future robot overlords and authentic ethical concerns about potential military applications for the company’s products. Presidential candidate Andrew Yang has bottled strange lightning with his dire warnings about the automation of human labor and his Freedom Dividend. Given the demoralizing trends of the past decade and growing consumer awareness, the 2019 Edelman Trust Barometer Technology Report (which uses survey data from fall 2018) demonstrates something surprising: in tech, we trust. 78% of the 33,000 survey respondents trust the tech industry, and technology is the most trusted sector of the economy overall. This is despite the report labeling 2018 the “Year of the Techlash”. However, when consumer trust in technology is examined more closely, we discover rising skepticism. Edelman survey respondents were asked to rate their trust of businesses in technology on a scale from 1 to 9 — ratings of 6 or 7 constituted weak trust, and ratings of 8 or 9 were deemed strong. Within the most developed markets, weak trust in the tech industry was more common than strong trust, but the opposite held true for less-developed nations. This suggests that consumers grow more disillusioned with the tech sector the more intimately familiar they are with it. When we look specifically at the belief that technology is beneficial to society, the decay is even starker. Globally, belief that technology has a positive impact on society is down 5% from the year before. Among tech employees, the drop is 7%. That 60% of the general population and 70% of tech workers still maintain faith that technology serves the greater good is a testament to just how dominant the sentiment used to be. It is 2019. The tech industry enjoys a great deal of consumer trust, but its good reputation is turning sour. The great curdling of trust in technology is not a foregone conclusion. There are steps that the tech sector can take in order to restore faith in technological progress as a force for the betterment of society, and none are new ideas. Plenty are already in practice, just not uniformly. Leaders in tech can elevate user privacy as a company value. They can treat workers well, including contractors and temps. They can protect employee activism and listen to public concerns. They can advocate for policies that ease the turmoils their products sometimes cause. Nobody is asking the tech sector to stop tech-ing. The cutting edge should stay sharp; it just shouldn’t be wielded blindly. Innovate, break ground, disrupt — but with compassion. -- -- This Publication collects articles on the history and culture of the computer in the United States.

As with any medical device, stethoscopes can be expensive (think $100 and up), limiting what most of us consumers can afford, or know how to use for that matter. While it’s not intended or certified for use as a medical device or diagnostic tool, the more affordable Stemoscope allows anyone to hear what’s going on underneath the skin using a smartphone and some headphones. “The Stemoscope is powered by a full-featured APP, for iOS and Android. It lets you discover and record the incredible sounds that exist all around us. Listening with Stemoscope reveals a new and expansive world. The sounds can be visualized, saved and shared conveniently.” The Stemoscope is an advanced stethoscope that was designed with STEM education in mind, with the idea that kids can learn about the sounds of nature; however, anyone can use it for any number of applications, including listening to babies inside their mother’s womb or even their pet’s heartbeat. The app enables users to visualize different sounds, record them, and share them with others. On the hardware end, the Stemoscope features a 50mAh rechargeable Li-ion battery, a 10Hz to 1000Hz frequency range, a pitch of +/- 2 octaves, 16X digital amplification in STEM mode, and measures in at 38mm (diameter) X 1mm (height). Not much is known about the microphone used in the platform beyond the materials its housed in (zinc alloy with chrome plating and ABS plastic). The Stemoscope can be used with any iOS and Android device and a good pair of headphones.

I’ve paraphrased them here for my own reference. I have found that having good 1–1s is important to build a good relationship between a manager and their team. However, it is very easy to get sucked into having 1–1s where you only focus on the immediate priorities. The steps listed below are useful for putting priorities in perspective and taking a step back to look at overall goals and expectations of both people. The answer is preparation. It’s rare that an amazing conversation springs forth when nobody has a plan for what to talk about. If you want to make 1–1s valuable, both parties should prepare. Here are some ideas to get started: Discuss top priorities: What are the one, two, or three most critical outcomes for your report and how can you help them tackle these challenges? Calibrate what “great” looks like: Do you have a shared vision of what you’re working toward? Are you in sync about goals or expectations? Share feedback: What feedback can you give that will help your report, and what can your report tell you that will make you more effective as a manager? Reflect on how things are going: Once in a while, it’s useful to zoom out and talk about your report’s general state of mind-how is he/she feeling on the whole? What’s making him/her satisfied or dissatisfied? Have any of his/her goals changed? What has he/she learned recently and what does he want to learn going forward? Identify: These questions focus on what really matters for your report and what topics are worth spending more time on. Understand: Once you’ve identified a topic to discuss, these next questions get at the root of the problem and what can be done about it.

There are others however that are still enthusiastic about its potential to unlock innovation, massively reduce bureaucracy and democratise global wealth. As ever in life, the reality lies somewhere in the gap between the pronouncements of the prophets of doom and the breathless exuberance of the evangelists. Finding the balance point and turning crypto and the blockchain into a credible opportunity is something that will occupy crypto and blockchain specialists for the next couple of years. In this set of linked articles, we will discuss what the crypto and blockchain sector can do to bring itself into the mainstream. The first question to ask is whether crypto actually needs to bother moving back into the mainstream? Couldn’t it happily and quietly exist in a quiet niche of technology and financial markets experts without worrying about chasing the mass market? We addressed this question in detail recently, but the short answer is that this would be a massively wasted opportunity. A market stands or falls on the amount of liquidity it attracts and the ease with which its assets, whether they are raw materials, products or services, can be traded. If the crypto sector decides to focus on being a niche, academic endeavour, it will fail to reach its potential. In turn, and many of the projects that are looking to take advantage of its unique features to attract financing, will fail to attract the traction they deserve. Equally, from a project financing point of view, if crypto remains focused on a niche, it will fail to deliver on one of its fundamental points of difference from traditional funding methods. Projects that currently try to raise funding through the traditional financial markets have to learn to present themselves in a certain way in order to attract the support of institutional investors. But there is a risk that this homogenised process compromises the vision of a project and innovation is stifled as a result. A tokenised blockchain-based investment process would be less time consuming, simpler and potentially considerably more democratic for innovative ideas that are trying to gain support because they can approach investors directly, without having to contort themselves to get through the traditional investment process. It could also create an environment that broadens the potential investment landscape for a wider variety of potential participants. A successful investment portfolio spreads risk across a variety of different places and crypto can deliver a new set of opportunities for investors of all sizes. If crypto should be encouraged to look beyond its specialist technological and financial markets cul-de-sacs, the question becomes how should it go about it? There are several factors to this, and the process is complicated by the sector’s credibility suffering what could politely be described as a bit of a knock during 2018. In the next three articles we are going to look at the steps that crypto and blockchain advocates can work to bring consumers back to the sector.

Follow 2042 -- Listen Share I’ve wanted to build my own website. I’ve been doing some research for the past week. Here are what I’ve learned along the journey. Now you have a domain name, and assumed you picked AWS as your cloud computing platform. And you chose WordPress to install to the AWS. Now it’s time to write your contents of the website. “WordPress” here means the software, the content management system. I am not referring to wordpress.com. The key different is wordpress.com is the blog/website platform. You don’t need to do anything. You just sign up an account and ready to go/write. But it’s not self-hosted anymore. If you want to self-hosted, then you’ll need to download WordPress software and have it installed to the computer. Please go here to download it. Besides WordPress, there is another popular open source blogging platform worth checking out: Ghost. Ghost was founded in April 2013, after a very successful Kickstarter campaign to create a new platform focused solely on professional publishing. Our mission is to create the best open source tools for independent journalists and writers across the world, and have a real impact on the future of online media. — Ghost.com Like WordPress, there are 2 ways you could use. One is just go to their website and sign up an account. The most basic plan will cost you $29 per month. The other choice is just download the software and install it to your server/cloud. I haven’t written about what web frameworks we can use. That’s because if we choose WordPress or Ghost, then we don’t need to use web framework anymore. It reduces our works a lot. If you want to focus on writing contents for your blog or you don’t want to spend too much time on programming your own website. WordPress and Ghost might be a better choice.

But as with any industry cliché, they become part of the jargon for a reason. As startups look to grow and scale up fast — more people, more ideas, more culture, more software — keeping it together is a constant struggle, and the potential for disarray is massive. History, however, shows us that the most successful companies are the ones that better managed to stay whole, aligned, and focused on what matters, systematically rejecting what doesn’t. As a complex adaptive system, there’s always a considerable degree of internal turmoil inherent to any fast-growing company. But constantly highlighting a common purpose that binds the different functions together is an essential ingredient for lasting success. In companies heavily driven by technology, having Product and Engineering (and Design) on the proverbial same page is therefore non-negotiable. New York Times bestselling author Daniel Pink has been endlessly quoted for his theory that motivation in knowledge work comes from mastery, autonomy, and purpose. While Pink focuses on the individual when it comes to the first two, through purpose we are actually tapping into our very human yearning to be of service to something larger than ourselves. This transcendence hints at a collective sense of belonging, where collaboration is key to achieving a shared, ultimate goal. It is no wonder startups emphasise mission, vision, and values as proxies to this common purpose that hopefully brings people together. However important, it can easily be too abstract. So how do we go about baking this into our daily operations? Specifically, how do we keep Product and Engineering in sync at all times? At TourRadar, we take this very seriously and, beyond being clear on — and constantly reinforcing — our vision of connecting people to life-enriching travel experiences, we have found the following to help immensely. We believe OKRs are a crisp, tangible, and ongoing definition of success. One of its key “selling points” is being a device for alignment at scale, to ruthlessly focus on what actually moves the needle. Having invested a lot of time in researching and learning how to do them “the right way” has led us to a point where we are comfortable with the process, and everyone is involved with some part of the OKR tree. Our cross-functional tech team OKRs, instead of a laundry list of initiatives, are focused on what metrics we set out to move — and these are shared between Product and Engineering, further reinforcing the alignment. Understanding what needs to get done, and what that implies from a technical perspective, is a constant “dance” that we promote down the org structure so that, at all levels, Product (including design and data) and Engineering have an ongoing conversation about what are the priorities and what trade-offs have to be made in order to execute them. What does success look like? What is a great product? What is important and what is not? Having clear, collective answers for questions like these is essential. When it comes to what a great product looks like, an engineer might be tempted to talk about the quality and cleanliness of the code. Yet, we don’t really sell code to our customers — we sell them an unparalleled booking experience, no matter how important good code is to consistently provide that experience over time. Everyone must share a common understanding of what we want a great booking experience to look and feel like, and how each of us then brings something to the table to make that a reality. We must not lose sight of the forest for the trees. For a long time, Facebook’s motto was move fast and break things. It served them well until the massive scale they achieved called for different operating principles. Similarly, at TourRadar, we have built a lot of technology that has served us really well in getting to the privileged position we find ourselves in. These achievements have now led us to look at the software development lifecycle in a more structured manner, so we continue picking up speed and building reliable, resilient software as we grow, instead of buckling under our own weight. And this understanding, yet again, is shared across the entire org between Product and Engineering. Fred Kofman, a long-time executive leadership coach at LinkedIn (now at Google), once highlighted the fact that the role of the goalkeeper in a football team is not simply to keep the ball from going in — it is, in fact, to help the team win, just like every other player. We find this incredibly relevant in aligning product, design and engineering people, as it underscores the fact that everyone brings a different (and complementary) skill set, but sharing the same goal and definition of success. With that in mind, a truly cross-functional organizational structure is what resonates most with us; what we see as the root of our agility and a forcing function for Product/Engineering alignment. According to Eric Bowman, VP Engineering/Digital Foundation at Zalando: Agility is just being able to respond quickly to changing business contexts. Beneath that, it’s being able to work well in parallel and to minimize the number of decision or alignment choke points. If teams need to constantly align with each other to get anything done, agility (and edge in the market) is lost. But alignment inside the team, between all its composing functions, remains key and is based on a clear team mission and clear objectives (and key results). An excellent tool for further enhancing cross-functional alignment is Domain-Driven Design. While diving deeper into this topic is something for a future post, suffice to say here that by focusing the discussion on the business processes, and having developers and domain experts iterating on their collective understanding of those (instead of jumping right into ill-informed technical solutions), alignment becomes an ingredient of the design and development process, instead of an outcome we hope for. Etsy’s ex-CEO, Chad Dickerson, once wrote as advice to first-time VPs of Engineering: “Partner absurdly closely with product and make sure you understand priorities and the head of product understands tradeoffs” At the end of the day, no alignment is possible if you don’t make an effort to simply understand the other side – there is wisdom that “you can’t understand someone until you’ve walked a mile in their shoes.” At TourRadar, we try to be very mindful of this and to promote this through interaction between Engineering and other functions in different ways: Much can be said about this topic, but at the end of the day, we believe it all boils down to a common mission we all choose to buy into, continuously decomposed in goals that make us want to get up in the morning and come to work. Everyone brings something unique to the table — but making an effort to understand others, and realizing that the whole can be bigger than the sum of the parts, is the (not-so-)secret sauce to keep that magical alignment going, and to keep steering the ship in the right direction.

Welcome to the June 25, 2019 edition of the Mission Daily Newsletter. Yesterday our CEO, Chad Grills, took over the newsletter; what’d you think? Stay tuned for more newsletters like this to come (ETA for the next one is Monday the 1st). We’re ready to take you into our next wormhole of musings. 🕳 “Dreams don’t work unless you do.” — John C. Maxwell “If you think of the subconscious, dreams, and sleep as the ocean, and you think of the waking, rational mind as the land, then the place where water crashes into land is super chaotic. That’s where all the waves are. And that’s where you surf. So liminal dreaming is surfing the edge of conscious and unconscious.” –Jennifer Dumpert When we say it’s time to chase your dreams, usually we’re being inspirational. Today? It’s literal. That’s because we’ve been inspired by Jennifer Dumpert’s research (more here) — a sleep expert who specializes in liminal dreaming.💭 What is liminal dreaming? According to Jennifer, “Liminal Dreaming is the space between awake and asleep — hypnagogia when you’re falling asleep, and hypnopompia when you’re waking up.” And, according to sleep experts around the world, this in-between space might be the key to some of your most interesting subconscious insights. From artists to innovators to scientists, some of the smartest, most creative minds in history have used liminal dreaming as a tool for self-discovery. People like Thomas Edison, August Kekulé, Albert Einstein, Mary Shelley, and Edgar Allen Poe have all indulged in the practice of traversing the space between sleep and wakefulness. So, if you’re feeling brave (and sleepy), you can try it today: 🛋When you’re sleepy, lie down on the couch or in your bed, and breathe really deeply. 🌬Exhale. As you exhale, exhale out all of your waking energy and any tension that’s in your body. Soften your mind. Exhale your daily to-dos, your thought processes, and just wait for whatever shows up. “It might be a little visual glimmer, might be points of light. It might be a sound. It might even just be something that you’re imagining, like you’re daydreaming. And then let that come into your consciousness.” 😌Exhale again. Exhale your waking energy out. Exhale any mental wordings that you have, everything. Let that animate the beginning of the hypnagogic dream, and let there be a feedback loop. Keep breathing deeply and continue to slow down your own mind and body, loosening your mental grip and letting all of the energy that you’re exhaling bring to life this hypnagogic dream. “Then you’ll just start to slide into the hypnagogic dream space. It’s really a balance between not falling asleep, giving yourself enough mental juice to stay in the space, but not waking up. It might be easier to find [that line] when you’re falling asleep at night, but then once you’ve learned to find it, you can always find it.” Ready to try it? Go grab a blanket, settle in, and give it a shot. Let us know what you find. 😉 Sleep is one of the most basic processes humans are capable of. Today, people brag about how little sleep they “need” to function. But functioning is not thriving, and getting quality sleep is what it takes for you to thrive all day, every day.

Tim Post is another sleep expert and can help walk you through the process. 🚗 Boring Company is back with a new video of a Tesla Model 3 zipping through an underground tunnel at a stomach-lurching 116 mph. 🌝 One small step for man, one giant leap for readers everywhere… From launch day to splashdown, here is a full oral history of the Apollo 11 moon landing. “In all of science fiction — Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and others — no writer had ever envisaged that lunar explorers would be in communication with people on Earth or, even more surprisingly, be able to transmit still pictures or moving images back to Earth. So we understood that was an important component of our flight objectives.” -Neil Armstrong ⛵️ ‘Solar sailing’ is the concept that a craft can capture the momentum of light and use it to propel itself through space. Just a theory now, but soon to be tested by this small, solar-powered spacecraft. 📈 For an interesting visualization of how brands and consumership have changed over the last decade, check out this mesmerizing video. 🤔 Do you really want to do yoga with goats, Susan? Or do you just want to try it because your coworker is posting about it on Instagram? “We often get infected by the desires of people around us. This should not surprise anyone. We also often start yawning when people around us yawn. And we get infected by the emotions of others — a film can seem much funnier if everyone in the audience is laughing out loud. Our emotions are influenced by the emotions of others. And our desires are influenced by the desires of others.” — Catching Desires Can we stop this infection? Short answer: Not really — so make sure you are around people whose desires you are okay with catching. Yoga with goats might not be your thing, but what about the Misfit Vapor 2?

The newest generation of smartphones, for example, is something many consumers buy simply because it’s the latest model. However, you may notice that features in the latest generation of a model revert back to previous generations. The company making the device got the message from consumers that previous characteristics were preferable. So, when determining whether or not a new technology is worth the investment, it’s worth carefully weighing the pros and cons. An eyebrow-raising trend in recent years is a new and increasing feature on shop floors — use of robotics. While automation is a significant factor in saving both manufacturers and labs alike on labor costs, advancements in robotics are also proving to be a cost-effective way of opening doors for collaborative projects between universities and SMEs. While the majority of Universities are modest in size, investing in new technologies such as advanced robotics, as well as recent innovations in software, may or may not be the way to go.

https://medium.com/@aliceainsworth/this-post-was-originally-published-in-march-2016-as-part-of-a-project-to-transform-the-nhs-website-d707939ac691?source=tag_archive---------52-----------------------,Are you thinking about social care?,Written by Alice Ainsworth,Alice Ainsworth,No Author URL,N/A,7 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Alice Ainsworth Follow -- Listen Share This post was originally published in March 2016 as part of a project to transform the NHS website (and more) We get asked quite often whether we’re thinking about social care as part of our work on NHS.UK. The simple answer is ‘yes’, but I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this because I think the actual answer should be ‘no’. Social care is a label that we, as government, have given to a collection of different kinds of support and funding arrangements for people with disabilities and illnesses. Social care is not a thing that people have or that people need ­ it is a solution, or a range of solutions, that government has defined and that differ across the country. By talking about social care as a bucket of things, we inevitably get caught up in the internal mechanics and processes of how people are ‘supposed’ to access the care that they need, of who pays for what, and which organisation has which statutory responsibilities. To try and explain this point, I’ve decided to share my personal experience, and how I think digital services (and NHS.UK) relate to care in the broadest sense. Experiencing excellent care in July 2012 my dad died from motor neurone disease (MND), less than 2 years after his diagnosis. MND is a terminal condition where the neurons in the brain stop reaching the muscles. For my dad this started with a dropped foot which made him stumble occasionally, but the muscle weakness rapidly made its way up his body and ended with him no longer being able to swallow. In the last few months his voice faded to a whisper and his breathing became more and more laboured, requiring an oxygen mask. When I think about the physical and emotional care that he ­ really, w​e a​s a family ­ received from health and care professionals, some of it was truly amazing. There was Teresa, the occupational therapist, who sat patiently with my mum and dad at the kitchen table for hours helping them to fill in the continuous healthcare assessment forms and whose arrival felt like a life­saver at a point of desperation ­ when they couldn’t cope but didn’t know what to do next. Teresa knew how to fast-track the application and within a few days they had funding agreed from the local council for homecare support. There were Jamie and Ann, the two regular carers that came in the mornings to get dad out of bed, wash him, brush his teeth, and then came back in the evenings to put him to bed. They were lively and thoughtful and they grew very fond of him, and him of them. They witnessed very personal and intimate moments in our lives and as a family we were incredibly touched that they took time off their shifts to come to his funeral. In the last few months of my dad’s life, Helen, a district nurse, talked my dad (and mum) through the choices he had about where he wanted to die, and explained what was going to happen. He wanted to stay at home, and it was the same nurse who came to the house with a sedative, easing him into a coma when he became agitated at the end, and who gave me an enormous hug before she left. This support was absolutely essential for my dad but also for my mum as his primary carer, and I feel that in many ways we were lucky. I feel like my dad was respected and dignified throughout the experience and had a ‘good death’, a concept I hadn’t really understood beforehand. But there are some moments that have stayed with me, when I felt entirely helpless and frustrated. This was when information or advice wasn’t available, wasn’t specific, or was wrong for our circumstances. It was when the ‘system’ failed to see my dad as a whole person, or when the bureaucracy took over people’s common sense. This is what I think NHS.UK can help with. How might digital improve the experience of care? I don’t think there’s anyone who believes that digital could be an alternative to actual care, but I do firmly believe there’s a lot that could be done to help people understand and access the care and support that they need. So, what could have been better in my experience? My dad had an open university law degree and had volunteered as an advisor for the Citizens Advice Bureau for a decade. There should be no form in existence that he would need help with, except that wasn’t the case with the continuous healthcare assessment forms. I had thought that as someone who understands the health and care system and who has a pretty good grasp of the internet, I could help my parents by coming up with a shortlist of suitable care agencies to use. I tried and gave up, because really the only way to find specialist support to come to a village on a county border was to get a recommendation from a local healthcare professional who understood the circumstances. There were lots of websites that provided directories of care services but none of them gave me what I needed to help make a decision. When the MND clinic said there were some apps and tools that might help my dad communicate more easily I spent hours doing research. I went round in circles because none of the tools I could find were appropriate for him. We instead bought an iPad that he could read the newspaper on. Although he couldn’t get out of his chair, or talk very well, he could still use his finger to swipe the screen and this gave him some independence again. Adding insult to injury, and entirely unconnected to his illness, my dad went deaf in one ear. And each time we met someone new we would explain this to them and ask them to face him when they spoke. It felt like the kind of thing that simply ought to have been at the top of whatever notes they had in front of them. But the thing that took up the greatest amount of everyone’s time and energy, was the process of identifying and ordering the equipment needed for dad to stay at home. There are so many examples of how this went wrong, which had a major impact on our stress levels and ended up costing my parents, and almost certainly the state, much more that it should have. The number of phone calls it took to get the commode or the wheelchair or the stockpile of incontinence pads taken away after my dad died was exasperating and upsetting. Understanding people’s needs, not organisation needs These are the experiences that frame the way I think about the design of digital services, and of service design more broadly. It’s what I think about when I hear some of our internal jargon like ‘shared decision making’, ‘access to service information’ or an ‘apps library’. It’s part of what makes me so determined that NHS.UK ­ and any other digital services we build ­ are built around the needs of the people who are going to use them. Because if we were all thinking about services in the broadest sense, you’d never put a MND clinic in an outbuilding with an uneven pavement, and you wouldn’t provide breathing apparatus that doesn’t have a back­up power supply to kick in if there’s a power cut. The approach that the NHS.UK team is taking is to listen to hundreds of people’s stories, from different backgrounds, age groups, ethnicities and regions. As a team we identify the common themes that emerge, and build prototypes of services to test with ‘real’ people to better understand what they need. Our vision for NHS.UK, based on this research, is to connect p​eople to the information and services they need. And this will be regardless of who provides it ­ central government, local government a clinical commissioning group or a charity. We intend to start by providing content that is relevant and action­ focussed and links people through to the best tools or services for them. We also want to start developing the building blocks for future services, like the work we have done on a d​iabetes planner,​ which would connect someone’s appointments, test results and prescriptions together with information. The information and services we talk about cover the whole spectrum of health and care, and apply to everyone, whether they have acne, a broken leg, cancer or dementia. I haven’t led the research for this project or produced the findings but I believe very strongly in what the team has done, because we’ve looked at people as whole people and tried to understand their lived experiences. And it’s why I think that in relation to digital services, and NHS.UK specifically, we need to stop talking about ‘social care’ as something that is different to any other kind of care. We need to keep focussed on the people we’re delivering services for, and with a service like this it’s pretty much everyone. The answer isn’t to add more social care content to NHS Choices, or commission a new directory of care services, or build a new tool to track people’s end of life care choices ­ though these things will probably help some people. The big prize comes if we can fundamentally shift the way we think about care, as something that is integral to people’s lives, and can’t be disassociated from NHS care ­or from their housing needs or benefits. We must stop reflecting our siloed government structures onto the public, who simply want to access and receive the care that they need. They don’t understand how the health and care system works and they shouldn’t have to. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png"

Usually, cases will offer selling points such as impact protection, extended internal batteries, or novelties like integrated kickstands and so forth while mounting/holding systems rely on where they can be affixed and how well they cradle the phone. The SwitchLok blends both features into one platform that promises ruggedness and versatility. According to the company: “SwitchLok is a system of phone case and mounts that auto-align — just get your phone close, and its magnetic personality takes over. Made for life in motion, it is the easiest and most versatile smartphone case and mount system available today. SwitchLok utilizes a patent-pending interface of rare earth magnets and interlocking design for a rock-solid connection. Even with all of its amazing functionality, the SwitchLok case is super thin.” On the case side, the SwitchLok features a rigid plate shielding on the back with shock-absorbing TPU material on its sides, and a ‘generous lip’ above the screen, which protects against impacts, but how well it does so isn’t known as there is no rating listed at this point. They do claim it can handle 13.3 G’s of force before separating from the mounts, so there’s that. The company states that the platform uses a patent-pending interface with interlocking design and rare-earth magnets to hold phones to the mounting brackets but doesn’t disclose whether those magnets are housed inside the phone case or the mounts themselves. Judging from the thickness of the case, my money is on the mounts themselves, with some sort of metal embedded within the case. The SwitchLok system features three different mounts that allow you to attach it to your arm (Arm Mount), bike/stroller (Ride Mount), and vehicle vent (Drive Mount), with each using the same magnetic attachment system, which auto-aligns the phone to the mount orientation. SwitchLok is currently being crowdfunded on Kickstarter with pledges starting at $70, which gets you a case (for the iPhone X/XS/XR/7/8 only), tether, and your choice of mount. -- -- 1 Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*SjJYUdHqel-qRpR_W86lkA.jpeg"

Signing the “Bancor Agreement” to evaluate the value of data with GMAT as a form of payment.,Written by Gowithmi GL,Gowithmi GL,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Gowithmi GL Follow -- Listen Share Recently, GoWithMi has cooperated with HIGO, the largest WiFi hotspot provider in Indonesia. Signing up what we called “Bancor Agreement” to evaluate the value of data provided by HIGO and give GMAT as a form of payment. The result has opened up new paths for blockchain projects and data providers to “cooperate and mutually benefitted”. It is reported that this is the first time in which blockchain technology is use to evaluate the value of travel data. HIGO have 500,000 WIFI hotspots in Indonesia covering more than 100 schools, more than 30 shopping malls and several airports in Indonesia. In this cooperation, the travel data comes from the mobile WIFI hotspot installed in the taxi by HIGO. The mobile hotspot generates a large amount of travel trajectory data while serving the passengers. In general, map service providers need to work with multiple data providers. Taking traffic conditions as an example, the red, yellow and green of the roads are generated by the data trajectory of the data provider and the data of the map service provider. Under normal circumstances, map companies such as Google and Baidu use the travel trajectory data to purchase the traffic conditions. However, each travel trajectory does not assess whether the overall road conditions are useful or valuable and they often reduce costs by suppressing the price of data providers. How much is the data worth? GoWithMi co-founder & CTO Simon pointed out that “the data value is not unified” is the core contradiction between map service providers and data providers in the past. The root cause is that although most of the data used by map service providers such as Google and Baidu are obtained from data providers, they often use the influence of large companies to squeeze the interests of data providers. In order to solve this pain point problem, GoWithMi tries to evaluate the data contribution value based on the blockchain and proposes the “Bancor protocol”, which replaces the bargaining between buyers and sellers by algorithmic consensus rules and directly pushes the data value from the contribution results. The content of the agreement can be simply described as: the real-time and freshness of traffic conditions as the contribution target and basis. With the decline of freshness, the demand for single road data becomes higher and the price increases. Any travel data updates this road. Road conditions can get a better return. Simon said that this will be a new attempt to “travel data cooperation” around the world, with a blockchain spirit and a mutual benefit cooperation with suppliers.

Humans are still the smartest existing creatures in the world, who are blessed with the ability to make the right decision at the right time and in the right manner. Humans are the smart thinkers who take the decision based upon the experiences, the prevailing situation and the consequences that might occur in the future. But, how if we say, machines can learn human-decision making skills and make the right decision at the right time? How if machines enact in the same way as we humans do? How if machines make smart decisions as we make? Wouldn’t it be a big success for the human race, as machines would do all our work and we would simply relax! Well Yes! This is what the concept of machine learning all about! In this article, we will discuss machine learning, it’s associated concept and the application areas. What is Machine Learning? Machine learning is basically a subset of artificial intelligence that lets machines learn from the experiences, past actions and accordingly make decisions. It can be viewed in our daily lives, such as when we buy things online, then we see a set of recommended products, similar products and a section particularly for “the one who bought this, also bought that”, all these recommendations are examples of machine learning. How does machine learning work? Machine learning empowers machines to make data-driven decisions, rather than making decisions that are programmed into the system. This data-driven decision-making approach lets the machines to learn from the performed actions and make the decisions when exposed to new data. Machine Learning algorithm uses a training data set to create a model. Now, whenever a new data is introduced to the Machine Learning algorithm, then it makes a prediction as per the model. If the prediction matches the model, then the Machine Learning algorithm is run, else, the Machine Learning algorithm is trained with the augmented training data set to make it acceptable. Different types of Machine Learning Supervised learning Supervised learning uses the same strategy as the real-life teachers to train students. Here, the dataset acts as a teacher and teaches the machine about the possible situations that may occur. Once the machine gets trained, it can make a decision whenever exposed to new data. Unsupervised learning In Unsupervised Learning, the machine learns from the observation of the structures. For example, we have apples, oranges, and bananas in a bowl, now when asked a machine to identify and separate them, then it recognizes the shape of each one of them accordingly. Reinforcement learning In Reinforcement learning, the machine interacts with the surrounding environment to find out the best decision that is to be taken. The machine follows a hit and trial method to find out the right decision that is to be taken. For every correct decision, it rewards itself with a score point and for the wrong one, it penalizes itself. This point structure lets the machine to improve its decisions. Expert View “Much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface. Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more. Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type — quietly but meaningfully improving core operations.”-Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon “We are entering a new world. The technologies of machine learning, speech recognition, and natural language understanding are reaching a nexus of capability. The end result is that we’ll soon have artificially intelligent assistants to help us in every aspect of our lives.”-Amy Stapleton, Founder of Tellables Machine learning is a game-changer for many sectors as it inhibits the ability to make smart decisions based on the outcomes that were observed from past decisions and experiences. Thus, Machine Learning is here to stay and evolve over time. It finds application in predictive analytics, pattern recognition, speech recognition and image recognition, which clearly depicts its significance and further growth in the coming years.

PCMag Follow PC Magazine -- Listen Share Apple’s upcoming subscription-based gaming service may not net large swathes of hardcore gamers, but its low-cost, casual-friendly library may make it a hit with people who don’t demand complex gameplay or a 40-hour completion time. By Jeffrey L. Wilson Apple Arcade has arrived on iOS devices, bringing with it a catalog that will, according to Apple, “exceed 100 games in the coming weeks as new titles are introduced.” The $4.99-per-month subscription service, which is slated to come to iPadOS and tvOS a bit later, features casual-friendly fare such as ChuChu Rocket! Universe and Sayonara Wild Hearts. The games look fine. Fun, even. That said, they’re very much not for me, at least in this early stage. And that’s fine. Although I loathe categorizing segments of the gaming community by the complexity of their favorite titles, using the “casual” and “hardcore” labels in the Apple Arcade context feels apt. After all, many Apple Arcade titles look like simple affairs, but one shouldn’t conflate simplicity with a lack of fun. If that was the case, Puyo Puyo Tetris wouldn’t rank as one of my all-time favorite video games. Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that Apple TV will be compatible with PlayStation 4 and Xbox One controllers, so there’s a chance that some developers will craft more console-like experiences for their Apple Arcade games. If that were to happen, though, I suspect it would be in extremely small numbers. A potential AAA-style, open-world Apple Arcade game would work better on a stationary platform such as Apple TV as opposed to a mobile platform like iOS, which would demand either less-than-ideal touch controls or carrying a gamepad of some sort. Neither solution sounds attractive. Still, there is an audience for Apple Arcade, one that Cupertino views as the entire household. Think about it: That $4.99-per-month subscription covers six family members via Family Sharing. So for just five bucks every few weeks, you can download an unlimited amount of Apple Arcade games and play them offline, which is a surprisingly good deal. In fact, Apple Arcade has the potential to be Cupertino’s Xbox Game Pass, a delightful service that’s responsible for Xbox revenue growth despite stale hardware sales. I once scoffed at the idea of exchanging ownership for a subscription service, but after watching a good friend gush over Microsoft’s $1 Xbox Game Pass deal that let him explore titles that he normally wouldn’t, I began to understand the appeal of a video game subscription service. With Arcade, Apple has the potential to tap a similar game-hungry audience, but one that doesn’t particularly care about cinematic cutscenes, hundreds of hours of gameplay, or complex control schemes. I think of someone like my iPhone-toting cousin who loves her mobile games and would likely play even more of them if they were bundled at an extremely affordable price. Apple Arcade could be her joint. I suspect that there are many other everyday people in the same position. If you spend a lot of time avoiding eye contact with fellow subway riders or laundromat users, you understand the value and importance of an easy-to-pick-up smartphone or tablet game. For five bucks per month, Apple Arcade gives you lots of ways to avoid interacting with random humans and pass some time. Me? I’d rather put on some headphones and listen to some tunes and put that $4.99-per-month charge toward something that interests me more, such as a YouTube subscription. But if you want Frogger in Toy Town on your phone, as well as dozens of other games, I’d never begrudge that choice.

By getting rid of drivers.,Published in Pay to Play,Kamesh,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Kamesh Follow Pay to Play -- Listen Share The top of this year signaled yet another race between ridesharing giants Lyft and Uber, this time a competition to IPO. As Lyft looks to edge out its rival, this presents an opportunity to understand the company’s direction moving forward, this time as a larger, more mature, and public company. Lyft’s S-1 shed light on a trend important for consideration. Even though revenues multiplied between 2016–2018 ($343.3MM — $2.16B), the overall net loss grew proportionally ($682.8MM — $911.3MM) in this duration, and Lyft is yet to reach profitability At the same time, a second trend to take note of is the number of active riders using Lyft in this time frame. This begs the question, what are the drivers of Lyft’s losses? It’s evident that, like any company in the process of scaling, Lyft is clearly experiencing growing pains. But the consistent uptick in active riders and the exponential growth in revenue suggests that the root isn’t a lack of sales, but expenses that it cannot overcome through its current model and offerings. Of these expenses, the most obvious is payment for drivers that shuttle Lyft passengers from point A to point B. Given that drivers are provided a base compensation with additional pay based on time and mileage of trip (with any relevant bonuses), this can often lead to a net loss on shorter trips after subtracting all of payments to drivers. This is often the case in big market cities such as New York, SF, and Boston, where a significant portion of ridesharing usage is for travel within the city and last mile travel. Drivers on ridesharing forums have reported average trip distances within similar cities of: “2.71 miles (n=301)” “3.3 miles based on 150 trips” “8kms (~5miles) is my average distance, based on past 600 trips” While short distance trips aren’t the only usage for ridesharing, they undoubtedly account for a sizable portion of the usage. It seems that Lyft and Uber have taken similar strategies to address this issue: 1.Lyft and Uber both recently acquired bike sharing services — Lyft acquired Motivate in July, and Uber acquired Jump in April 2. Lyft and Uber are heavily investing in autonomous vehicles. Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group is on a mission to bring self-driving vehicles through advancements in hardware, perception, maps, and simulation. Uber’s recent acquisitions of Geometric Intelligence and deCarta seem to fall perfectly in line with furthering those efforts. As of March 14th, Uber is in talks with Softbank and Toyota to potentially raise $1Billion for its self driving unit. Lyft has a dedicated group to the same mission as well, citing reduction in traffic and accidents as motivations behind this venture. In October, Lyft unveiled its fleet of autonomous vehicle developed by Aptiv, and followed up by acquiring Blue Vision Labs, a London based company centered around developing machine perception technology. Furthermore, the threat of Waymo being poised and primed to unveil its own autonomous ride hailing service has kept both Uber and Lyft on their heels in this space. 3. Lyft and Uber maintain that their drivers are independent contractors, not employees. This prevents them from being subject to minimum wage increases and requirements, thus mitigating any further spikes in expenses. While this transition will not happen overnight, both are hopeful that the next two decades will prove to be sufficient timeframe for the technology to mature and the the system to roll out.

As a part of living, the digital era is now understanding that our private information is more revered than ever before. As you must be aware of the news stories about data breaches and the ID theft abound, the effects are being felt across the globe by millions of consumers. In 2018, as per the reports and analysis, approximately 945 data breaches lead to 5 billion records which were being compromised by the unauthorized users. Anything that relies on the internet for communication or is connected with different smart devices can be insecure by the breach. Henceforth, this shows why cybersecurity is important for the IT world. The world with cybersecurity is never a dull one. And it is really important to understand “what is cybersecurity?”, that is being explained below. To make your thought more clear on ‘What is Cybersecurity?’, it refers to a set of different techniques being used to protect the integrity of the programs, networks, and data from the cyber-attack, unauthorized attacks, and damage. We can also call cybersecurity as an information technology security. In other words, we can define cybersecurity as a practice of protecting the systems, programs, and networks from the digital attacks. The main aim of these cyber-attacks is at changing, accessing or destroying the sensitive information, interrupting the normal business process and hence, extorting money from users. According to Forbes, we can assume that the global security market is expected to reach 170 bn by 2020. This expeditious growth is being fueled by an unlimited array of technology trends, which even includes an onslaught of initiatives with some ever-evolving security requirements, like the internet of things (IoT) and ‘bring your own device’ (BYOD). The security needs are yet being extended with the rapid adoption of cloud-based applications. Cybersecurity is not only useful in the government and the business, but even your tablet, cellphone, and computer can also use it, which contain the information that hackers and other such criminals would be willing to have. Some of this information would be other user’s names, bank details, birthdate, email address and more. For instance, consider a hacker had access to your information. What next? He could send text messages or an email to everyone, by using your name, and may encourage them to click on a link that contains malware, such as “Hey Albert, I guess you’d like this! Click Here.” In a connected world, we each are equally responsible to protect ourselves and even the people we interact with, and this all can be done with the proper guidance of cybersecurity. After having an overview of ‘What is Cybersecurity?’ let’s have a deep dive on ‘why cybersecurity is important?’ Cybersecurity is important in n number of aspects. As we are all aware that unprecedented amounts of data are stored on computers and other devices at military, government, corporate, medical and financial organizations. And a significant portion of that data can prove to be a piece of sensitive information, that can be anything like personal data, financial data, intellectual property, financial or any other type of data, to which unauthorized access or exposure should have negative consequences. To protect this sensitive data, cybersecurity came in the ground. As organizations transmit the data across the networks and to the other devices, here cybersecurity describes the dedicated disciplines for protecting that sensitive data and the even the systems used to process it. The importance of it arises when the sophistication and volume of the cyber-attacks grow, especially to those tasks where the safeguarding of information is related to the national security, health, or financial records. As per the reports of the nation’s top intelligence officials have cautioned that digital spying and the cyber-attacks are appearing as a top threat to the security of the nation which even eclipsing the terrorism. Here’s how the cybersecurity plays a major role. You may like to read- Your Complete SEO Guide: How does SEO Work? You might be thinking about what types of cyber threats can affect your system, well we have an answer for all your question. Below are some listed threats you should be aware of; It’s always important that one should be aware of some top cyber threat that can target computer networks or personal computer devices, computer information system and many other devices. A Denial-of-service attack overwhelms a system’s resources and from thereafter it will not be able to respond to any service requests. In another way, it can be stated as an attack that floods servers, networks or systems with anonymous traffic just to exhaust the resources and bandwidth. Here attackers can even use multiple compromised devices to launch this attack. A man-in-the-middle attack is one of the most popular attacks across the globe, this attack occurs when a hacker inserts him/herself between the ongoing communication of a client and server. For instance, the attack may unfold like this, SQL (Structured Query Language) inject has become a very common attack on the database-driven websites. This attack mainly occurs when a malefactor executes a query to the database via an input data sent from client to server. An attacker can carry out the SQL injection simply just by submitting malicious code into a vulnerable website search box. Malware the term itself suggests that malicious software, which breaches a network through its vulnerability, especially when a user clicks some unknown dangerous links or email attachment that further will automatically install a risk software to the system. Once the malware is being installed to the system it can covertly obtain the sensitive information by transmitting the data from the hard drive. It can even disrupt certain system components and renders the system inoperable. You may like to read- What is Blockchain? The phishing attack is a practice by an attacker for sending some fraudulent emails that appear to be mailed by some trusted sources, and therefore they aim at gaining the personal data like a credit card or login information or even to install malware on the victim’s machine. It is noted by some deep analysis that phishing is increasing the cyber threat. Now you know some of the cyber threats, and very well understood why cybersecurity is important. Let us see how you can safeguard your system with the help of cybersecurity companies. With high-profile cyber-attacks in the news almost every day, it is high time to go for cybersecurity companies that can protect your system. With so much money at stake, thousands of vendors have flooded in the market, which in turn makes it difficult for you to select the right company. Here are some of the most reputable cybersecurity companies you can go for. With the dominance in networking, Cisco even has a very impressive roster for the cybersecurity products. With the acquirement of a number of security vendors, they offer a complete lineup of cybersecurity products of any vendor. It is one of the largest cybersecurity vendors in the world. When things come to Microsoft, cybersecurity products might not strike to your mind, but actually, it sells quite different cybersecurity solutions. The most widely used cybersecurity solution by Microsoft is access management and active directory for identity. They even offer several cybersecurity solutions through its Azure cloud computing platform. McAfee is one of the most popular cybersecurity service providers. It offers antivirus and identity protection for consumers, as well as a wide range of cybersecurity products for the enterprise. As per the company’s website, it has a wider range of consumers with 80% of the world’s largest bank.

It boasts 95% of the customer satisfaction rate and 90% of the renewal date. After having some insights on the cybersecurity companies, let us through some light on what will be the future of cybersecurity? It is assumed that cybersecurity is tightly connected with the future of advancement of the cyberspace and the information technology. Today, most of our critical systems are driven and interconnected by computers. In the future, we can say that this connection will be even tighter and more decision automated. That indirectly will require effective cybersecurity. As the complexity and connectivity of these systems are directly impacted by their level of vulnerability. In short, a cybersecurity defense system will be in need to turn into a more sophisticated thereby to cope up with a huge amount of data. As cyber-attacks continue to skyrocket and criminals continue to use more and more complex methods, the shaping of future cybersecurity with cutting-edge technology will be the main goal.

The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 1 billion people today depend on assistive technologies of some form, with the number set to rise to more than 2 billion by 2050. There are, however, two features in the next phase of this relationship which warrant our attention. First, the impending wave of enhancements go beyond therapy. Instead of restoring impaired or lost function, enhancements are offering the opportunity to increase functionality beyond the norm. Second, there is also an observable trend of personalisation. Individuals seek out and selectively apply forms of enhancement that would realise their preferred lifestyle and (subjective) vision of themselves (and their children). How should we respond to these trends? Focusing on the technologies themselves would miss the heart of the matter. Technology is but a means to an end, and it is important to explore the human motivations driving such enhancements. This piece will briefly outline four such motivations and how they are already playing out. First, upgrading — a desire to overcome disability through technological innovation, where disability is just a problem statement awaiting the right technological solution. Hugh Herr, the head of MIT Media Lab’s Biomechatronics group, who lost both his legs to frostbite during a mountain-climbing accident put it this way: “as a society, we can accept the proposition that humans are not disabled. A person can never be broken. Our technologies are broken and disabled. We can transcend disability through technological innovation.” · The bionic limbs that Herr has developed through the fusing of biomechanics, modelling software and microprocessors have helped countless amputees walk and even dance again with the natural gait of an able-bodied person. · Sensory substitution or the creation of new senses for humans is another example. Leveraging the neuroplasticity of the brain, David Eagleman, a neuroscientist has developed a vest for the deaf, which maps sounds onto vibration patterns on the vest, allowing the deaf individual to feel and eventually “hear” again. Peter Meijer, a research scientist in the Netherlands, has created artificial vision with a technology called vOICe which represents visual information as sounds. Pat Fletcher, a proficient user of vOICe who lost her sight at age 21, consistently surprises many with her new ability to “see” grayscale images in her head.[1] Second, prevention — enhancements delay the onset of disease or prevent the occurrence of disease altogether; prevention is better than cure. · Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and pre-implantation screening techniques provide diagnostic information concerning an embryo before it is transferred to the uterus. These techniques are used to prevent single-gene disorders such as Tay-Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anaemia and Huntington’s disease. While such use is broadly acknowledged to be therapeutic, our growing knowledge of and ability to manipulate the human genome through tools like whole-genome sequencing, CRISPR Cas-9 hasten the advent of “designer babies” where selection of traits like enhanced athletic ability, avoidance of autism, reduced obesity, sexual orientation, intelligence just to name a few, become possible. Third, optimisation — enhancements to maximise the body’s peak performance. This is already prevalent in competitive sports where anti-doping boards and athletes play a complex cat-and-mouse game of enhancement and evasion. The extension of this to individuals is seen in the following examples: · Microdosers take small doses of drugs to achieve their desired state, such as heightened alertness or creativity. For example, nootropics start-up HVMN, based in San Francisco, successfully markets smart drugs to a growing user base who pop the right combination of pills (e.g. Go, Rise, Sprint, Yawn — the products’ names) to achieve their desired outcomes whenever necessary. Besides HVMN, there is also a new generation of LSD users (~18,000 microdosers on a Reddit Forum) who use LSD to treat anxiety or depression, or to achieve an additional level of creative stimulation. · Human Oocyte Cryopresevation (or egg-freezing) is the procedure to preserve a woman’s eggs, which includes extraction, freezing and storage. This can be seen as a form of optimisation since it allows women to preserve their peak fertility and pursue their careers first while also maintaining the option of having a child in the future. Apple, Facebook and Google are just some of the big companies that offer subsidised egg-freezing as part of their employees’ health coverage benefits. Fourth, self-expression of personal identity or ideology. These individuals see enhancements as a means to express themselves and their true identity, even if the procedures are dangerous or may result in irreversible or unforeseen consequences. Some examples include: · Bio-Hackers or Grinders install implants (e.g. magnets, RFID chips) that give them new abilities or do cool party tricks. Originating as an underground subculture, grinders have become increasingly mainstream with online companies like Dangerous Things and Grindhouse Wetware offering DIY kits for purchase with accompanying video demonstrations. One such bio-hacker, Rich Lee said “my conception of an ideal self is something like a Mr. Potato Head, where I can just swap in and out different prosthetics for different senses and abilities.” · Transgender individuals use cosmetic surgery and hormone injections to achieve their transition in a long drawn and painful process. Advances in stem cell technology coupled with the ability to grow organs could make the future of gender transition safer, more effective and potentially less objectionable on health and safety grounds. As personalised human enhancements that go beyond therapy become mainstream, the human motivations driving their adoption of technology should always remain a key consideration that guides our response. Technology is often lauded as the means for us to transcend ourselves but in this case, it also presents a way for us to understand ourselves better and what truly makes us human.

This is why I felt the we should include technology in this (a Software to be exact), where your performance is measured via tasks completion and way-point (against KPIs) across the year and based those points you are appraised.

In 2017, when Jason Tashea and I first taught our Georgetown Law students about risk assessments, our lesson summarized those debates in a lecture and discussion. Afterwards, we worried that students were taking away a simple, wrong lesson: if a software tool is sufficiently “accurate”, it will solve the problem presented and it does not require further investigation. The discussion shouldn’t end there. Software has framing power: the mere presence of a risk assessment tool can reframe a judge’s decision-making process and induce new biases, regardless of the tool’s quality. This past fall, we wanted our students to engage with this broader, ecosystem-level issue, and to understand the far-reaching consequences that pretrial detention can have on defendants. This reflects the overall goals of our practicum class, Criminal Justice Technology, Policy, and Law. We want our students to not just be familiar with technology, but be able to think critically about how software and data-driven tools can influence legal ecosystems — sometimes in unexpected ways. After all, law students aren’t training to be programmers or data scientists: they’re training to be advocates. Legal education needs to equip law students to analyze novel technologies in context, and build arguments for or against them. So, we built a simulation. We call it Detain/Release. Detain/Release puts students in the role of a county judge at a bail hearing, and prompts them to detain or release individual defendants pending trial. In the simulation, students are served cases that look like this: Included with a distorted picture of the defendant is his or her biographical and charge details, a prosecutor’s recommendation, a defendant’s statement, and a risk assessment. The risk assessment provides a low/medium/high likelihood that a defendant will fail to appear, commit a crime, or commit a violent crime. Under the hood, it uses U.S. Census and Bureau of Justice Statistics data to generate defendants and alleged offenses. The simulation can generate millions of unique defendants. We added additional mechanics to make the world of the simulation more complete. Detained defendants are placed in a county jail with limited capacity and stay there for a period of time, depending on their charge. Released defendants may commit a violation or new crime while on release, which appears in the form of a (sometimes histrionic) local newspaper article: These two mechanics simulate outside policy pressures. To visualize this, we include two meters: jail occupancy, which increases with detentions, and public fear, which increases with violations. If either reaches its full capacity (indicated as a bar at the top of the user interface) the simulation ends. These meters are optional; the simulation can run with or without them. To facilitate the use of Detain/Release in the classroom, we built a teacher-facing “remote control” to configure runs of the simulation with different options, and generate a virtual “classroom” for students to join. We also built a real-time dashboard, which we projected onto the wall. While students were using the simulation, we presented a simple live view, showing each participant’s progress during the current run. The dashboard also included a statistical view, which breaks down the actions of all participants in the classroom: how often are defendants detained? How influential is a risk assessment or a defendant’s story? Finally, we included a line-up of faces: defendants that students detained and released. Our lesson interspersed runs of the simulation with short lectures about risk assessment tools and class discussions about the students’ decision-making process. Our mini-lectures covered the basics of bail, the mechanics and implementation of risk assessments, and legal and technical challenges to their use in pretrial. We wanted students to put themselves in the role of a judge, and think about how they would make pretrial detention decisions. We began with a tutorial run that students completed on their own: ten defendants, no risk assessments. After that, we divided students into groups and had them do three full runs of the simulation. We wanted students to talk about how they made their decisions, during and after the simulation runs. By the third run, we found that students are invested in the simulation and in the detention and release decisions they’ve made. Throughout, we were deliberately opaque about how the simulation worked — about how accurate the risk assessments actually were, and about what probabilities “low”, “medium”, and “high” corresponded to. For the most part, no one asked, either in our classroom or during our tests of the simulation. Despite that, as they progressed through the lesson, students began to feel more confident and assured in their detention and release decisions. They built interpretive systems to quickly make decisions from the information they had been given. Some of their rules and systems were expected: high violence usually meant detention. Others, less so: after seeing two female defendants fail to appear, one team began detaining women by default. After the third and final run, we showed students the consequences of their decisions, with one last dashboard view: How did pretrial detention decisions affect defendant outcomes? This reveal takes the air out of the room. It drives home the framing power of the risk assessment tool we had presented them: students relied on it, deeply, despite receiving no promises about its accuracy, and “corrected” for it in random ways. This had consequences. For their part, our students responded positively to the simulation, and recommended we use it again in future classes. We wanted our lesson to demystify algorithmic tools for students, and build a foundational understanding of how these tools work, how they’re applied in practice, and whether those applications are appropriate. But most of all, we wanted students to reconsider risk assessments, not as tools for predicting the future, but as tools that can rewrite a defendant’s future long after their case has ended. We’re excited about Detain/Release, and plan to keep improving on it. As we do, we’re hoping to engage with legal communities around the country. To help us improve Detain/Release, we’re planning a limited release of this simulation to other professors and trainers, along with the additional classroom features. UPDATE: You can try the simulation now at https://detainrelease.com We’re exploring how Detain/Release might be deployed as a research tool in addition to a teaching tool. Our dashboard can provide deep insight into how people react to the simulation under different parameters. Similarly, there are real world applications that could leverage this tool to help train stakeholders adopting or contemplating a pretrial risk assessment. If you’re interested in using Detain/Release for teaching, training, or research, and are willing to provide feedback, please reach out. -- -- Insights from the Berkman Klein community about how technology affects our lives (Opinions expressed reflect the beliefs of individual authors and not the Berkman Klein Center as an institution.)

Earlier this week, the company announced that it had acquired the retail advertising start-up, Promote IQ, which helps clients like Kohl’s and Office Depot get ads onto their e-commerce offerings. Media buyers see this acquisition as the latest move for the company to expand its ads offering beyond search via Bing — which was rebranded to Microsoft Advertising this past April — and differentiate its offering. “Microsoft signaled a commitment to advertising as a business with the expansion beyond Bing ads, the acquisition of LinkedIn, the application of AI capabilities, and the ongoing networking of their properties to create native, audience-based targeting solutions,” wrote George Manas, president and chief media officer at OMD, in an email. “These strategies have increased the scale and diversity of advertiser options and have given Microsoft unique assets in data and context that are likely appealing to advertisers across most industries, beyond just B2B.” The company is the fourth-largest ad platform behind Google, Facebook and Amazon, per eMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom, who added that while “it’s a healthy business it’s still relatively small for Microsoft” and that the company is “looking for areas of growth wherever they can get it.” In the fiscal year 2019, search advertising revenue generated $7.6 billion for Microsoft, up from $7 billion in fiscal year 2018, according to the company’s SEC filings. By comparison, Alphabet, Google’s parent company, reported $32.6 billion in ad revenue during its second-quarter earnings last month. During that same period, Amazon reported $3 billion in revenue in a category it titles “other,” which is mostly made up of ad revenue (in 2018 that category generated a total of over $10 billion). What Promote IQ adds to the business Currently, Microsoft’s ad business is primarily composed of search and network advertising on Bing and LinkedIn, respectively. Adding Promote IQ to its roster of offerings to advertising clients will bolster the company’s commerce and retail capabilities which will ultimately open up potential new ad sales growth, wrote Manas. “As more of the e-commerce market shifts ad dollars to Amazon, both Google and Microsoft will be seeing less money on their platforms,” wrote Melissa Burdick, president of Pacvue, a software solutions company, in an email. “This undoubtedly is getting Microsoft and Google’s attention and since Microsoft isn’t even in the top three major digital ad players anymore, they are going to want to reclaim a seat at the table. For a while, Microsoft has been trying to diversify its digital ad business from just search and more into cross-channel display ads.” The Promote IQ acquisition will help Microsoft court retailers and dig into ecommerce, which is a key growth area in the coming years, according to buyers and analysts. Microsoft’s native tools for paid search are already “far more sophisticated,” per Burdick, “but Amazon has key retail data points that directly tie into the sale. Those retail elements all have to be manually added into most of Microsoft’s ad offerings.” While some of Microsoft’s advertising revenue streams are mature, like Bing’s search offering, others like LinkedIn and retail, via Promote IQ, are still growing, said Haggstrom. “They are putting their investment dollars where they see future growth,” he said. “It’s an area of rapid growth. Amazon was able to grow ad revenue by triple digits last year. Microsoft — and the entire e-commerce industry as well — want to piggyback off that.” Playing the long game The company’s acquisition of LinkedIn in 2016 was a turning point for how buyers viewed its advertising offering. “The LinkedIn acquisition was really, really huge for them,” said Noah Mallin, head of content and experience at Wavemaker. “It reset people’s understanding of how Microsoft was looking at the marketplace. They’ve done a really good job of diversifying [LinkedIn’s] ad products, there’s a lot more video.” But LinkedIn didn’t just add another revenue stream for the company’s ad business, it helped refine its B2B focus. Mallin sees the Promote IQ acquisition as another way that the company is zeroing on B2B clients by growing its ad business by helping other businesses capture consumer attention via e-commerce. “If you’re trying to reach the business decision-makers using their solutions can be very effective,” said Mallin. “If you’re trying to go deep with a lifestyle focused Gen Z audience they may not be the first. But that’s okay, it’s good for them to have a healthy niche that they can exploit.

https://medium.com/@joshnewall/your-tech-stack-is-hurting-your-companies-culture-2e4851b2d50e?source=tag_archive---------160-----------------------,Your tech-stack is hurting your company’s culture,So how does this all apply to culture?,Cohort-X,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Cohort-X Follow -- Listen Share In Benjamin Hardy’s article ‘This 10-Minute Night Routine Guarantees Success Your Next Morning’, he suggests you pull a piece of floss out the night before and put it on the bathroom counter. By doing this, he says you’re much more likely to floss. By pulling it out the night before, you’re taking a step towards alleviating what he calls ‘decision fatigue’. Flossing may sound simple enough, but there’s actually quite a few decisions that lead up to whether or not you’ll actually floss. Ben Hardy outlines the steps as follows: These steps may seem small and trivial, but regardless of how you look at it, they’re steps you need to take. I followed Ben Hardy’s suggestion, and sure enough, I started flossing more in the morning. Then I started applying this idea to the rest of my day. Before I closed my laptop for the day, I started to do a few things differently. I would identify ten companies I wanted to prospect into the following day, and I would set a task on each account and pre-start my task queue. Secondly, I would identify an article I wanted to read. Lastly, I would write down any loose ends from the day on a small white board by my desk. This could be anything from booking my next dentist appointment to packaging up that recent Amazon return. When the following morning came around, I noticed two changes. One — I was able to dive right into the tasks I had set the previous night in a way I normally wouldn’t have been able to. Usually, I would need a coffee, time to wake up, and figure out what it was that I needed to do. I would normally spend key moments trying to clear the fog and figure out a structure to my day. Two — I had more intention. Rather than spending the first part of my morning clearing the fog and adapting to being awake, I had tasks pre-set and ready to dive into. Three — There was not as much ‘friction’ preventing me from diving into the tasks I had preset the night before. Think about it from the vantage point of cooking. Think about the difference between looking into a fridge full of food unsure of what to cook… and opening the fridge and pulling out a bowl that was pre-filled with three eggs, spinach, cheese, and spices. The whole idea is preventing decision fatigue from setting in early, and allowing your mind to easily flow with creativity rather than having to make a ton of micro-decisions. By removing these micro-decisions and diving right into your meaningful tasks of the day, you’re allowing your brain to do what it does best (especially in the morning). You’re allowing it to ACTUALLY think. Now… let’s apply this to the inner-workings of a company. Most companies have tech stacks that require far more micro-decisions than what’s even close to being necessary. Some of the reasons behind this? Not to say the above reasons are wrong by any means, but my point is to show that ‘ease-of-use’ was often overlooked, when it should have been one of the primary factors of evaluating new tools. I will attest and say this is clearly changing in the right direction. In HBR’s ‘Why great employees leave great cultures’, Melissa Daimler states that there are three elements to a culture: behaviors, systems, and practices. If we think about the technology stacks that run our companies, it’s not hard to see that the technology we use plays a role in all three of those elements. A technology stack that focuses on removing micro-decisions in effect allows our people to be more creative and to actually work harder. Rather than making small and frequent decisions that don’t have any effect on the actual value we deliver, employees are able to do what they do best: be human. Here’s an example: if it takes 18 clicks to reach out to a prospect, the thought I put into the engagement of that prospect will most likely be lower as my mind gets sucked into the manual cog of tasks I put it through. However, if it took me 6 clicks to reach out to that prospect, my mind has more time and freedom to do what it does best — think critically. Every manual step your employees have to complete to get to the point where they have to actually think is one more added friction point. It should fall to leadership to focus on removing these friction points, and one of the easiest places to start is the tools your employees use. As technology advances, the tolerance for menial tasks is dropping. However, it takes discipline and sound strategic foresight for a company to adopt a technology strategy that not only unites a company under a simplified operating stack, but one that also enables human execution. In addition to the idea of removing micro-decisions, let’s also just think about it from a simplicity standpoint. If we have an incredibly complex tech stack, we now need to have employees take large amounts of time to train incoming employees. Incoming employees will have to be reliant on veteran employees to help them gain fluency in the companies systems. Leaders need to find a way to make that cycle as quick and simple as possible. If we have systems that are incredibly easy to adopt and learn how to use, that means our new employees gain confidence quicker and our veteran employees get to spend more time doing their jobs. I don’t know about you but to me, that benefits company culture. So if we start to think about this from the perspective of a tech-stack, we start to see how influential it can be to your employees day to day life. If we focus on removing repetitive tasks, embracing simplicity, and making it as easy as humanly possible to get to the point of the work process where your employees can actually be human… you are heavily impacting your companies culture for the better. Foosball tables and free beer are great perks, but by no means are they going to provide sustained satisfaction among your employees. I would argue that by allowing your employees more time to focus on human tasks and enabling them with tools that they love to use, you’re allowing them to do the things that truly drive satisfaction and happiness in the workplace. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*fid1cZlRt5d1IdokgjwiIQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*fid1cZlRt5d1IdokgjwiIQ.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*fid1cZlRt5d1IdokgjwiIQ.png"

At six months old, I immigrated to this country, passed off as my aunt’s child at the border. I grew up in a poor and blighted area of a small desert city in the Coachella Valley, a place where drive-by shootings were common. My parents worked round-the-clock in country clubs serving the rich guests, then spent their “off-time” landscaping desert gardens and cleaning homes to provide for three growing boys. I’ve worked a series of odd jobs since I could remember (I can tile your home, change a toilet, and install a water drip system). I was the first person in my family to graduate from high school, then to go on to college, and now to work a white-collar job. I thought a college education was the only way to build generational wealth for my family and community I’m one of the millions of people of color in the U.S. who share this journey. I had the blessing of going to Stanford on need-based financial aid. While I worked tirelessly to do everything “right” to secure a job — I was involved in several students groups, worked in DC over the summer, picked up a few fellowships along the way — I knew the majority of my classmates came from wealth. Their parents went to top Ivy league schools, ran Fortune 500 companies, and took family ski trips during winter. While I was at Stanford, I had no idea that my school sat in the middle of a tech boom. The proliferation of startups up and down the Bay would eventually contribute to my classmates’ own wealth, spurred by equity and IPO’s, but a career in tech wasn’t something that registered for me. While some of my classmates earned starting salaries of $80,000+, I was content to make $22,000 my first year out of college, and my parents were proud that I went to work in a suit every day. The Leaky Tech Pipeline is leaving communities of color without wealth generating opportunities The technology industry is a $1.4 trillion industry and contributes to 10.4 million jobs in the U.S. These are well paying jobs and and high profile IPOs that are creating the next generation of millionaires, yet so many of us — particularly people of color, are shut out. The fast pace of technology innovation is leaving women and people of color behind, as early as elementary school. A combination of systemic, institutional, and psychological barriers contribute to “leaks” throughout the tech pipeline. Students of color lack access during CS classes in high school. As you move down the pipeline, only 20% of Black and Latinx students earn Bachelor’s Degrees in CS. Further along, you see an even lower percentage of women and people of color in tech roles or receiving only 1% of venture capital funding. This is the tip of the iceberg of a historic, complex and nuanced problem. Five years into my non-profit career, I found out that several of my classmates were making six-figure salaries while I was still making less than $40,000 per year (although this was still higher than my parents’ combined income). I’m sure I walked by famous founders while I was an undergrad — or maybe even stayed in the same room — of people who built tech empires from their Stanford dorms. I didn’t understand how to build wealth, or even how to obtain it. I was just trying to stay above water, balancing academics, dorm life, internships, and part-time work, all while feeling major imposter syndrome. I chose to work in tech access rather than the tech industry because I wanted to create economic opportunity, despite only successfully raising 1% of $12.5M in grants solicited In 2015, I co-led the launch of the LA Tech Talent Pipeline program at the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. The program ramped up to connect sixty of LA’s technology companies to 4,000 talented community college students (low-income, first generation, students of color) majoring in tech-related majors like software, IT, or UX/design. These students had the skills and the grit but lacked the access to tech networks. One day, I calculated how much funding our program had solicited and secured after receiving another “No” from a funder. Over the course of 1.5 years, I had applied to $12.5M in funding and only secured about 1%. I spent 50% of my time writing, jumping on calls, taking meetings, and making pitches for 1% of funding. In an industry where billions of dollars are managed by foundations of different sizes, I could not understand how little funds actually were being awarded to organizations like ours. So yes, I went to Stanford but wasn’t exposed to CS classes or even operational roles at tech companies. I didn’t found a startup or even join one. Not because I couldn’t, but because I didn’t understand how or why. So I thought I would help other students like me get the jobs that I wasn’t exposed to. But even, after I realized there was a whole other world open to us that could help build generational wealth for our family and communities, I was still facing barriers. This is the story of what systemic exclusion looks like, since before I was born. Nobody wanted or tried to keep me out (which wasn’t true of my dad or grandparent’s generation); in fact, everyone was super supportive of whatever I *chose* to pursue since my elementary school days. But growing up first-gen in the Inland Empire, you don’t dream of becoming the next Mark Zuckerberg or even a tech founder of a small startup. You don’t become what you don’t see. We’re funding cross-sector collaborations that seek to dismantle systemic exclusion from the technology industry: #TechDoneRight That’s what brought me to the Kapor Center. As a Program Lead, I’m privileged to take my lived experiences to inform and shape the development of our Tech Done Right Challenge, which seeks to unlock financial resources to spur more bold solutions that foster inclusive tech ecosystems nationally. My time is focused on learning about the experiences of other entrepreneurs who are launching programs to help underrepresented women and people of color land a job in tech or launch tech startups. Ultimately, these solutions will help spur generational wealth for these communities. Next week, we’ll be formally announcing a $1M opportunity to galvanize those working on the frontlines building inclusive tech ecosystems. The Tech Done Right Challenge will identify these trailblazers, giving them the space, time, and resources to collaborate in new ways with startups, tech companies, city governments, and funders to tackle the systemic exclusion facing communities of color breaking into tech. Stay tuned for our announcement coming soon!

According to him the speed at which biology and technology have merged into the world of bioengineering; we will soon have a new race of sapiens called the useless class. What he means is that we will have to upgrade ourselves with new skills every few months or days or hours. The way bioinformatics is speeding, machine learning will know what we want or are thinking before our action takes place. There will be no “free will”. The cognitive revolution will be faster than the actual human brain thinking. Algorithms will know us better than knowing ourselves, and we will start trusting them more than ourselves. “ To err is human” will no longer exist because our thoughts, emotions and actions will be governed by Google, Facebook, and the likes of these. We look up to the clouds to pray to God (imaginary or real, according to each one’s perception). Now our prayers will be answered by the same clouds which belong to IBM, or Google. Technology has even taken over the clouds. By the way, all this will be more trustworthy than the human to human interface. Isn’t it amazing? The trust factor in society today is already at an all-time low than before. This is the future of the 21st century. I am bowled over this thinking. If we look around, the useless class has already begun. I feel very much that I belong to this class. When it comes to technology, I am worst than a slow learner, forget upgrading myself. A silicon chip can have a faster transmission than our neurons. They follow logical steps than the bundle of 3 trillion synapses. The best will be our individual perceptions will be lost or discredited because there will be no feeling involved in the machines. Feeling bring in thoughts, perceptions, philosophical dilemmas and cultural ethos. This whole gamut of nonsense will be lost. The machine will guide me on what I feel, how I feel, why I feel, when I feel and guide me towards LOGICAL being. So we are no longer just chemistry but engineered chemistry. This is soon going to be true then the professions related to human science will vanish. Like the leap in quantum physics, we will exist in different dimensions of the universe at the same time. This is no science fiction anymore. Is this a threat or a boon of evolution to mankind will remain a personal choice. Our 100gms of forebrain tissue which is a seat of imagination has already made fiction a reality now. But we forget that along with imagination we also have a variant only present in humans called EMPATHY. Imagination and empathy separates us from the animals. These two characteristics give us higher order precedence. We are the superior race of sapiens going towards making ourselves the creator(God Like). We control the fortunes and misfortunes of our race. We are taking away control from nature and engineering it. We all want to be rational beings. Don’t we? Rationality means logic, discipline and rules. Follow them and success is assured. This differentiates us Asians from the westerners. This cultural divide comes from the need for control. They wanted to control everything and so they did, they changed the thinking of the world. So from being a polytheistic race, we get enamoured by a monotheistic race. We copy them. We want to be like them. Unfortunately, nature has a final say in everything. The West is still studying the patterns in nature. “The butterfly effect “ is the best example. We can predict the future but can we control the NOW. Can we control our mind to nothingness but concentrate on our breath only. The flutter of a mind, the wink of an eye and the speed of thoughts is what brings them to seek for calmness or salvation. Then they look to the east.. and we will still keep looking at them….

Therefore, it is safe to assume that a ventriloquist's dummy, which sits neatly in the Venn diagram between dolls and the carnival, is the most terrifying thing in existence. Maybe it’s the dummy’s dead eyes or its unnaturally rosy cheeks that cause it to fall squarely into the uncanny valley, but that’s where it definitely resides. Sadist Redditor WaitingForRetirement decided to add to the nightmare fuel by building this Arduino-controlled dummy head. This dummy head may look like it came out of some unnamed — yet definitely haunted — curiosities shop, but it was actually designed and constructed from scratch by WaitingForRetirement. They carefully 3D-modeled the head in Autodesk Maya mesh-modeling software, and then 3D-printed it in multiple pieces. Those pieces were then masterfully sanded, primed, and painted to look exactly like the textbook picture of a ventriloquist’s dummy. WaitingForRetirement could have stopped there, and the dummy’s head would still have been extremely disconcerting, but they took it a step further with Arduino control. An Arduino board is connected to a handful of hobby servo motors that close and open the eyelids, move the eyes, turn the head, and open and close the mouth. Right now, WaitingForRetirement is using a pair of joysticks connected to the Arduino to control that movement, but plans to eventually do so with software control. WaitingForRetirement doesn’t explain the purpose of the dummy head or what he’ll do with it, but we know it’ll end up terrifying somebody. UPDATE: WaitingForRetirement has since attached the head to an upper torso (dressed in son’s shirt) and did away with the joystick, making this that much more awesome yet creepier. -- -- Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg"

Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen and seeing the gasses bubble off from the electrodes almost looks like magic. I came to know about it when I was a 11 year old, while reading a science book. I knew I had to try it. Since then I have experimented on may different setups, mostly trying to separate the two gasses and trap the hydrogen. Hydrogen in small amounts can be fun ! For example bubbling it through soap water, you can produce hydrogen bubbles which rise up in the air, since it is so much less dense, and its pops with a sound when lit with a match. But recently I had started thinking seriously about a hydrogen balloon project. There are two options available for producing hydrogen in-house….either from electrolysis of by acid-metal reactions! The later can be quite exothermic and along with hydrogen lot of water vapor comes off too. While electrolysis can be challenging too, specially for long periods; electrodes corrode, fluids leak and get inside the balloon being inflated someway or the other! I planned on building a reliable electrolysis contraption, which can sustain steady reactions over long periods of time. The corroded electrodes (the anode mostly) end up as anode mud and if not cleared out of the electrolyte, can clog the entire setup. To tackle this I build a circulation and filtration system which takes up electrolyte from oxygen chamber and circulates back into the hydrogen chamber after passing through a ‘ ‘sponge’ filter(both chambers are internally connected off-course). A 12V pump is used for the purpose. The electrolyte I use is generally brine or acidulated water. The cathode is a series of razor blades while the anode is made of strips of AA battery casings. The anode erodes fast and needs to be replaced from time to time. Fresh electrolyte can be added from the oxygen side by removing the bottle cap! After electrolysis the oxygen is allowed to escape (the internal pressure of both the chambers remains at 1 atmosphere), while the hydrogen passes through two water towers for cooling and condensing off of any water vapor carried out of the hydrogen chamber along with the hydrogen(the electrolyte gets heated up during the process). It is to be noted that the pressure of the collected hydrogen can just fill up a balloon which has a fixed surface area, before and after inflation ! That means rubber balloons, which exert back pressure, cannot be used. The Hydrogen Collector is ready ! Hoping, will start with the high altitude hydrogen balloon experiment soon ! -- -- Design || Research || Experiments Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*0k_R8YYpJCletBqDcxaSGw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*0k_R8YYpJCletBqDcxaSGw.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*0k_R8YYpJCletBqDcxaSGw.jpeg"

This basic fact has enabled the false idea that the value-neutral language of code erases the all-too-human qualities of prejudice from the equation. After all, we think of humans as fallible thinkers, prone to unfair judgments and biased decision-making. Machines should, in theory, be better — shouldn’t they? We’re accustomed to hearing the (misconceived) story by now. Brilliant software is revolutionizing our world, making it a more equitable and colorful place. Yet, the thought held by many that AI decisions aren’t so susceptible to prejudice is unfortunately and demonstrably false. While it’s true that a program can assess pure data without making the snap judgments that humans do, the info in question is often predicated on the biased decisions of the past and present, in the real world where discrimination is a constant reality for marginalized people. In an industry heavily invested in its image as a world-shifter, it’s become sadly apparent that discrimination is sustained, not eliminated, by many of our “revolutionary” tech tools. www.datadriveninvestor.com At their essence, algorithms are a set of procedural instructions. Making sense of unfathomably huge data sets is time-consuming at best for a human, so we leave it to these pre-made programs to handle the most miraculous jobs in software. Most of the innovative software services we use today rely on AI — from Netflix suggestions to the autocorrect in our smartphones. Such problem-solving is inherent to today’s technology. It’s important, then, to take a closer look at just how these miracles are happening. It’s thanks to many lines of code (often measuring well into the millions) that even the most rudimentary software applications work, and it’s within the algorithms in those indecipherable-to-most lines of data that the world of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning takes form. A legacy of inequality There are too many examples of “intelligent” software failing to give equal credence to users from marginalized groups. A facial recognition algorithm that’s mostly tested on white faces will falter at recognizing black ones. A smart assistant trained to recognize human speech fails to be properly attuned to women’s voices. These shouldn’t be read as mere quirks to be corrected with software patches, but a call for the tech industry to take a good, long look at their practices. The ramifications are much graver than misidentification in consumer tech. Prison sentencing, home loan allocations, auto insurance rates and more have shown discriminatory practices historically, and many such decisions are now being handed over to AI. As algorithms take on a greater role in such processes both governmental and private, it becomes apparent that the prejudices of yesterday and today are showing no signs of slowing after the high-tech handover. With the tech firms that created it showing disinterest in correcting this injustice, it’s left to other powerful players to fix the wrongs created by algorithmic bias. Change from above As with other hot-button issues in tech responsibility, our neighbors across the Atlantic are taking a promising lead in this regard. Governmental leaders in France and the UK have been particularly outspoken about the need to ensure more equitable practices in the technology that’s steering our lives. Such missives from the top make for a hopeful future, but much work remains to be done. Here in the US, my hometown of New York City has initiated a full audit of the usage of algorithms in city business, the first such project in the nation. Established in May of 2018, the Automated Decision Systems Task Force will present their findings in a full report at the end of this year. Made up of scientists, professors, advocates, and other experts, the group may well put a halt on much of the algorithmic processes that have been known to discriminate. Fight for the future While this may be interpreted as too little, too late, the fact is that for all the progress that’s been made, thus far the tech titans have only scratched the surface of AI’s potential. The usage of “intelligent” tech will continue to grow, so it’s absolutely vital that action happens now. The damage that’s already been done can’t be negated, but through conscious action we can prevent tomorrow’s marginalized people from being hurt even more by an expansion of algorithm-driven consumer and governmental applications. New York’s program will hopefully serve as a call to action not only for other municipalities but for programmers and their employers to stay conscious of the limitations of smart algorithms. Major initiatives to increase diversity in the science and tech industry also promise to fight discrimination at the root with a more diverse workforce that understands firsthand the historic prejudices that continue to afflict the tech world and the greater society surrounding it. As technology itself evolves, there’s no reason to believe that the industry that creates it can’t progress simultaneously.

รวมถึงความบันเทิงในรูปแบบต่างๆ ก็สามารถเข้าถึงได้อย่างง่ายดาย ซึ่งเทคโนโลยีเหล่านี้ไม่ได้มีผลกระทบเพียงในแง่ของการใช้ชีวิตแต่มีผลไปจนถึงเรื่องการงานและเศรษฐกิจในปัจจุบัน เนื่องด้วยความเปลี่ยนแปลงทางด้านเทคโนโลยี การประกอบอาชีพจึงมีความสอดคล้องไปกับเทคโนโลยีในปัจจุบันด้วย โดยในหลายๆ สายอาชีพการที่มีเทคโนโลยีมาช่วยแบ่งเบาภาระนั้นถือเป็นเรื่องดี และในขณะเดียวกันก็เป็นฝันร้ายของอีกหลายๆ อาชีพที่อาจจะตกงานเนื่องมาจากมีเทคโนโลยีบางอย่างเข้ามาช่วยทำงานแทนได้ ทั้งนี้ทั้งนั้นเราควรที่จะเรียนรู้เพื่อปรับตัวให้ทันต่อยุคสมัยที่กำลังจะเปลี่ยนไป อย่างที่เราทราบกันดีว่า ในปัจจุบันเริ่มมีการหันมาใช้หุ่นยนต์และปัญญาประดิษฐ์แทนแรงงานในหลายสาขาอาชีพมากขึ้นแล้ว ส่งผลให้บางอาชีพในอนาคตข้างหน้าอาจจะถูกหุ่นยนต์และ AI แย่งงานอย่างแน่นอน เรามาดูกันดีกว่าว่าอาชีพที่มีแนวโน้มที่จะได้รับผลกระทบมีอะไรบ้างเพื่อจะได้เฝ้าระวังและเตรียมตัวเพื่อปรับตัวให้เข้ากับสิ่งที่กำลังจะเกิดในอนาคต o อันดับที่ 1 พนักงานขายหรือพนักงานแคชเชียร์ — ทุกคนน่าจะเคยเห็นซูเปอร์มาร์เกตที่มีเครื่องจ่ายเงินอัตโนมัติมาบ้างแล้ว โดยเฉพาะซูเปอร์มาร์เกตที่เป็นไวรัลมากๆ อย่าง Amazon Go หรือแม้กระทั่งตอนนี้ในไทยเองก็เริ่มมีร้านสะดวกซื้ออย่าง 7-eleven ที่มีจุดให้บริการ Self-check out เรียบร้อยแล้วเพื่ออำนวยความสะดวกและเพิ่มความรวดเร็วในการชำระสินค้า ทำให้ในอนาคตพนักงานขายหรือพนักงานแคชเชียร์อาจจะไม่จำเป็นอีกต่อไป o อันดับที่ 2 พนักงานธนาคาร — ในปัจจุบัน ระบบ Mobile Banking นั้นมีความสะดวกสบายมากๆ ไม่ว่าจะอยู่ที่ไหนเพียงเชื่อมต่อเครือข่ายอินเทอร์เน็ตก็สามารถทำธุรกรรมออนไลน์ได้ จึงส่งผลให้ธนาคารต่างๆ มีการปรับลดสาขาลง เพื่อให้สอดคล้องกับรูปแบบเศรษฐกิจและความต้องการของลูกค้าและแน่นอนว่าเมื่อมีการปรับลดจำนวนสาขาของธนาคารลงแบบนี้แล้วนั้น พนักงานธนาคารก็จะได้รับผลกระทบด้วยอย่างแน่นอน o อันดับที่ 3 พนักงานขับรถ — อย่างที่ทราบกันดีในอนาคตอันใกล้ รถยนต์ประเภท Self-driving จะมีการนำมาใช้จริงบนท้องถนน อีกทั้งเทคโนโลยี AI ที่ใช้ทำงานร่วมกันนั้นปัจจุบันก็มีความฉลาดและปลอดภัยมากขึ้นจึงทำให้ในอนาคตคนทั่วไปจะเปิดใจและหันมาใช้รถยนต์ประเภทนี้มากขึ้น ส่งผลให้อาชีพพนักงานขับรถในอนาคตอาจจะโดนรถยนต์เหล่านี้แย่งงานได้ o อันดับที่ 4 นักข่าว — ตอนนี้ที่ประเทศจีนมีการนำนักข่าวที่เป็น AI มาทดลองใช้อ่านข่าวซึ่งสามารถทำงานได้อย่างแนบเนียนราวกับว่าเขาเป็นคนที่เป็นนักข่าวจริงๆ ข้อดีของ AI ในด้านนี้ก็คือสามารถอ่านข่าวได้ตลอด 24 ชั่วโมงไม่มีพักกันเลยทีเดียว แบบนี้อาชีพนักข่าวคงมีร้อนๆ หนาวๆ กันบ้างอย่างแน่นอน o อันดับที่ 5 พนักงานรับโทรศัพท์หรือตอบคำถาม — ในอนาคตเราอาจจะไม่ได้เห็นพนักงานรับโทรศัพท์หรือตอบคำถามที่เป็นคนอีกต่อไปแล้วเนื่องจากปัจจุบันหลายๆ องค์กรก็ได้ลองนำ Chatbot หรือ Bot เข้ามาช่วยแบ่งเบาหน้าที่เหล่านี้มากขึ้น โดยเจ้าพวก Chatbot หรือ Bot เหล่านี้ก็ย่อมจะรองรับอารมณ์ของลูกค้าได้ดีกว่าคนอย่างแน่นอน o อันดับที่ 6 เอเยนต์ท่องเที่ยว — ตอนนี้มีเว็บไซต์ท่องเที่ยวมากมายที่พร้อมจะให้ข้อมูลเกี่ยวกับสถานที่ท่องเที่ยวต่างๆ รวมไปถึงเว็บที่รวมทั้งที่พัก ตั๋วเครื่องบินทุกอย่างครบในที่เดียว ทำให้คนพึ่งเอเยนต์หรือบริษัทนำเที่ยวน้อยลง เนื่องมาจากในปัจจุบันข้อมูลนั้นสามารถเข้าถึงได้ง่ายมากๆ จึงส่งผลให้ในอนาคตบริษัทท่องเที่ยวอาจจะน้อยลง o อันดับที่ 7 แรงงานในโรงงานอุตสาหกรรม — โรงงานอุตสาหกรรมต่าง ๆ เริ่มหันมาใช้หุ่นยนต์ในกระบวนการผลิตมากขึ้น เพื่อทดแทนกำลังของคนที่ไม่สามารถทำงานบางอย่างได้ เช่น ยกของหนัก ซึ่งการนำหุ่นยนต์มาใช้นั้นในบางอุตสาหกรรม หุ่นยนต์ก็สามารถนำมาใช้ทดแทนแรงงานคนได้ทั้งหมดแล้วก็มี เพราะในอุตสาหกรรมบางประเภทนั้นใช้หุ่นยนต์แล้วมีความคุ้มค่ามากกว่า และในอนาคตเทคโนโลยีจะยิ่งมีพัฒนาไปอย่างรวดเร็ว ทำให้หุ่นยนต์มีความสามารถและใช้ทดแทนมนุษย์ แน่นอน ท่ามกลางวิกฤตก็ยังมีโอกาสดีๆ เกิดขึ้น เนื่องด้วยปัจจุบันทั้งในและต่างประเทศ รูปแบบของตลาดแรงงานมีการเปลี่ยนแปลงไปอย่างต่อเนื่องอีกทั้งอย่างที่กล่าวไปในข้างต้น เทคโนโลยีต่างๆ ในปัจจุบันและที่กำลังจะเกิดในอนาคตนั้นมีความสามารถที่จะช่วยแบ่งเบาภาระการทำงานและทดแทนแรงงานของมนุษย์ได้ สิ่งที่เกิดขึ้นตามมาก็คือเทรนด์อาชีพที่เปลี่ยนแปลงไปตามยุคตามสมัย ในเบื้องต้นได้มีการแนะนำอาชีพที่ได้รับผลกระทบไปบ้างแล้ว ในส่วนนี้จะมาพูดถึงสายงานที่จะมาแรงและเป็นที่ต้องการในอนาคตกัน o อันดับที่ 1 งานด้าน IT — สายงานด้านนี้ถือว่ามาแรงสุดๆ ในยุคสมัยนี้เลยทีเดียว มีความต้องการภายในตลาดแรงงานที่สูงมากเนื่องจากหลายๆ ประเภทธุรกิจได้เริ่มก้าวเข้าสู่ยุคดิจิทัลกันแทบจะทั้งหมดแล้ว ภายในหลายๆ องค์กรได้มีการนำเทคโนโลยีอาทิเช่น AI, IOT, Big Data รวมไปถึง Blockchain เข้ามาผนวกไปกับการทำงาน สายงานนี้จึงถือว่ามีความจำเป็นและสำคัญอย่างมากเพื่อช่วยให้ธุรกิจสามารถดำเนินงานได้อย่างราบรื่นยิ่งขึ้น o อันดับที่ 2 งานด้าน Content Editor และ Reviewer — ในปัจจุบันรูปแบบการทำการตลาดมีการเปลี่ยนแปลงไปมากเนื่องด้วยมี Social Media ที่สามารถเข้ามาช่วยในการทำ Marketing และเข้าถึงกลุ่มผู้บริโภคได้มากกว่าการทำการตลาดในรูปแบบเดิม ในการที่จะทำการตลาดให้มีความน่าสนใจยิ่งขึ้นนั้น ปัจจุบันต้องอาศัยการสร้าง Content ที่น่าสนใจร่วมไปกับการนำ Influencer ที่มีฐานลูกค้าที่เราต้องการมาช่วยในการเข้าถึงลูกค้าได้ง่ายและรวดเร็วขึ้น o อันดับที่ 3 งานด้านการออกแบบ — เป็นอีกหนึ่งในสายงานที่จะถูกแย่งงานโดย AI ได้ยากเนื่องจากงานด้านนี้อาศัยความคิดสร้างสรรค์และประสบการณ์สูง ถือเป็นเรื่องยากที่ AI จะทำสิ่งเหล่านี้ได้ อีกทั้งในอนาคตเรากำลังก้าวเข้าสู่ยุคที่เทคโนโลยีโลกเสมือนจริง (Virtual Reality) สายงานด้านการออกแบบ VR และ AR จึงเป็นที่ต้องการเป็นอย่างมาก o อันดับที่ 4 งานด้านโลจิสติกส์ — ปัจจุบันการซื้อขายบนโลกออนไลน์นั้นมีความนิยมมากขึ้นและในอนาคตจะยิ่งสูงขึ้นไปอีก เนื่องด้วยเทคโนโลยีที่สามารถช่วยอำนวยความสะดวก ผลลัพธ์ที่ตามมาก็คือวงการการขนส่งโลจิสติกส์จะมีความต้องการของตลาดแรงงานมากขึ้น o อันดับที่ 5 นักกฎหมายดิจิทัล — โลกในปัจจุบันมีความเปลี่ยนแปลงไปอย่างรวดเร็วยิ่งมี Social Media และมีการใช้งานมากขึ้นทำให้ลักษณะการกระทำผิดทางด้านกฎหมายในรูปแบบใหม่ จึงต้องมีกฎหมายมารองรับและดูแลการกระทำที่เกี่ยวข้องกับความผิดดิจิทัลเหล่านี้ ในอนาคตเทคโนโลยีต่างๆ จะเข้ามามีผลในการดำรงชีวิตของเรามากยิ่งขึ้น ดังนั้นงานด้านกฎหมายดิจิทัลจะมีความต้องการมากยิ่งขึ้นเช่นเดียวกัน o อันดับที่ 6 งานด้าน Startup — รูปแบบการทำธุรกิจมีการเปลี่ยนแปลงค่อนข้างมาก จึงเกิดเป็นธุรกิจ Startup เพื่อที่จะตอบสนองความต้องการของผู้บริโภค อีกทั้งธุรกิจประเภทนี้ยังถือว่าเป็นอีกกลไกที่จะมีส่วนช่วยให้ประเทศของเราก้าวเข้าสู่ยุค Thailand 4.0 โดยในอนาคตแนวโน้มในการเกิด Startup เพิ่มขึ้นมีสูงมาก o อันดับที่ 7 งานด้านพลังงาน — ยุคนี้กระแสของพลังงานทดแทนเป็นที่พูดถึงและนำไปใช้มากขึ้นในหลายๆ วงการ จึงไม่พ้นที่วิศวกรที่มีความรู้ด้านนี้จะได้รับผลดีไปเต็มๆ เนื่องด้วยเทรนด์ในอนาคตคนจะหันมาสนใจเกี่ยวกับพลังงานทดแทนและพลังงานสะอาดมากขึ้นเห็นได้จากตัวอย่างรถยนต์ในปัจจุบันที่ใช้พลังงานทดแทนเช่น น้ำ หรือ ไฟฟ้า เป็นที่ต้องการมากยิ่งขึ้น นอกเหนือจากอาชีพมาแรงที่กล่าวไปในข้างต้นแล้วนั้น ด้วยยุคสมัยนี้ที่มีความเปลี่ยนแปลงไปอย่างรวดเร็วส่งผลให้มีอาชีพเกิดใหม่ขึ้นมาเพื่อตอบสนองความต้องการของตลาดแรงงานในยุคดิจิทัลมากขึ้น บางอาชีพเรียกได้ว่าน่าสนใจมากๆ จะมีอะไรบ้างไปดูกันเลย o อันดับที่ 1 นักกีฬา E-sport — เทรนด์การเล่นเกมในอนาคตจะไม่ใช่เรื่องเล่นๆ อีกต่อไป จากที่เราเห็นกิจกรรมการเล่นเกมในปัจจุบันก็พอจะทราบแล้วว่าคนหลายๆ กลุ่มหันมาสนใจการเล่นเกมมากขึ้น ให้การสนับสนุนมากขึ้นจนเกิดเป็นกีฬาชนิดใหม่ขึ้นมา ซึ่งการเป็นนักกีฬา E-sport ก็ไม่ได้ต่างกับนักกีฬาทั่วๆ ไปเท่าใดนักเพราะต้องมีการหมั่นซ้อม ฝึกกลยุทธ์ ศึกษาคู่แข่งอย่างสม่ำเสมอ โดยหากยิ่งมีความชำนาญในเกมๆ นั้นมากเท่าไรรายได้ที่จะได้รับก็จะมากตามไปด้วย o อันดับที่ 2 Smart Farmer — ในประเทศไทย อาชีพเกษตรกรรมนั้นถือว่าเป็นอาชีพที่เป็นรากฐานของคนไทย โดยเราสามารถนำเอาเทคโนโลยีที่มีในปัจจุบันมาประยุกต์กับการทำการเกษตร ซึ่งจะช่วยยกระดับให้ประเทศไทยไปสู่ Thailand 4.0 ยิ่งขึ้น อีกทั้งการนำเทคโนโลยีมาใช้ก็จะสามารถช่วยให้เกษตรกรได้ผลผลิตที่มากยิ่งขึ้นและยังช่วยอำนวยความสะดวกในเรื่องของการจัดการงานต่างๆ ในพื้นที่เกษตรกรรม o อันดับที่ 3 วิศวกรการเงิน — อาชีพนี้เรียกได้ว่าเป็นอาชีพที่ใหม่มากๆ และยังไม่ได้เป็นที่รู้จักกันเท่าไรนัก โดยอาชีพนี้จะนำความรู้ในเชิงวิศวกรรมศาสตร์มาผนวกรวมกับความรู้ทางด้านการเงินและการลงทุน ซึ่งจะทำให้สามารถนำไปใช้ในการบริหารความเสี่ยง วิเคราะห์หลักทรัพย์ การลงทุนและการประกันภัยภายในสถาบันการเงินต่างๆ o อันดับที่ 4 วิศวกรหุ่นยนต์ — ในอนาคตวงการเทคโนโลยีจะยิ่งพัฒนาขึ้นไปอีก โดยเฉพาะอย่างยิ่งเทคโนโลยีเจ๋งๆ อย่างปัญญาประดิษฐ์หรือที่เรามักเรียกกันติดปากว่า AI จะมีแนวโน้มที่จะถูกนำมาใช้ในชีวิตประจำวันมากยิ่งขึ้น ดังนั้นในการที่เทคโนโลยีจะออกมาเป็นรูปเป็นร่างได้นั้นก็ต้องอาศัยวิศวกรในออกแบบและสร้างสรรค์ ซึ่งเชื่อว่ามีแนวโน้มที่จะเป็นที่ต้องการของตลาดแรงงานมากขึ้นเรื่อยๆ o อันดับที่ 5 นักบินโดรน — ในปัจจุบันโดรนไม่ได้มีไว้เพียงแค่ใช้งานสำหรับบุคคลทั่วไปเท่านั้นเพราะในปัจจุบันนั้นมีการใช้โดรนเพื่อจัดส่งสินค้าและในอนาคตคาดว่าจะมีการใช้โดรนเพื่อขนส่งคน ซึ่งอาชีพนักบินโดรนจะเป็นที่ต้องการมากขึ้นในอนาคตแน่นอน o อันดับที่ 6 นักออกแบบเทคโนโลยี VR — ในอนาคตอันใกล้นี้เราจะเข้าไปใกล้โลกเสมือนยิ่งขึ้น ซึ่งเทคโนโลยีนี้ก็ส่งผลดีต่อธุรกิจบางประเภท คาดว่าในอนาคต เราอาจจะอยู่บ้านโดยไม่ต้องออกไปไหนแต่ใช้เทคโนโลยีโลกเสมือนดึงโลกมาไว้ในมือคุณเหมือนในหนังเรื่อง Ready Player One ที่คนในหนังอยู่ในบ้านแต่ใช้ชีวิตอยู่บนโลกเสมือนในเกมเป็นส่วนใหญ่ ดังนั้นเพื่อสร้างเสริมประสบการณ์ที่ดีจะต้องผ่านการออกแบบที่ดี ซึ่งอาชีพนักออกแบบในอนาคตจะมีการแข่งขันสูงและเป็นที่ต้องการมากขึ้น o อันดับที่ 7 บริษัทท่องเที่ยวบน VR — จากที่กล่าวไปในข้างต้นเรื่องของเทคโนโลยี VR จะช่วยให้คนไม่ต้องออกจากบ้านแต่ก็สามารถออกไปเที่ยวได้! เพียงแค่ใช้อุปกรณ์ของ VR ซึ่งบริษัทท่องเที่ยวแบบนี้ในอนาคตคาดว่าจะเป็นเทรนด์ใหม่ถัดจากเกม VR ในปัจจุบัน โดยที่การแข่งขันจะเกิดขึ้นมาจากในเรื่องความสมจริงของประสบการณ์การท่องเที่ยวนั้น ยิ่งบริษัทไหนมีความสมจริงมากลูกค้าก็จะมากตาม ถือเป็นเทรนด์การท่องเที่ยวที่เอาใจคนที่ไม่ชอบเดินทางมากเลยทีเดียว จากที่กล่าวมาทั้งหมดนั้นคงจะช่วยชี้ให้เห็นถึงเทรนด์ความเปลี่ยนแปลงของตลาดแรงงาน รวมไปถึงความต้องการของลูกค้าอันมาจากการเปลี่ยนแปลงในการดำรงชีวิตในปัจจุบัน เนื่องมาจากการที่โลกของเรานั้นเกิดเทคโนโลยีต่างๆ ขึ้นมากมาย นอกจากที่เราต้องปรับตัวเพื่อดำรงชีวิตร่วมกับมันแล้ว เรายังต้องเรียนรู้ถึงผลดีและผลเสีย วิกฤตและโอกาสที่มีผลต่อเราเพื่อเรียนรู้ที่จะอยู่กับเทคโนโลยีเหล่านี้ได้อย่างยั่งยืน — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —

Sharing its crown jewel might reshape the internet.,Bloomberg Businessweek,No Author URL,N/A,9 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Member-only story Bloomberg Businessweek Follow Bloomberg Businessweek -- Share By Robert Epstein Recognition is growing worldwide that something big needs to be done about Big Tech, and fast. More than $8 billion in fines have been levied against Google by the European Union since 2017. Facebook Inc., facing an onslaught of investigations, has dropped in reputation to almost rock bottom among the 100 most visible companies in the U.S. Former employees of Google and Facebook have warned that these companies are “ripping apart the social fabric” and can “hijack the mind.” Adding substance to the concerns, documents and videos have been leaking from Big Tech companies, supporting fears — most often expressed by conservatives — about political manipulations and even aspirations to engineer human values. Fixes on the table include forcing the tech titans to divest themselves of some of the companies they’ve bought (more than 250 by Google and Facebook alone) and guaranteeing that user data are transportable. But these and a dozen other proposals never get to the heart of the problem, and that is that Google’s search engine and Facebook’s… -- -- Covering the business world like no one else.

As new Offering Managers participating in a six-week bootcamp in Austin, we are no exception. During the first week of our onboarding experience, we attended a workshop to learn about IBM’s commitment to give back and its rich history of volunteering. On July 31, 2018, we gave back as IBMers for the first time by hosting a career chat at Austin-based nonprofit organization Latinitas. Latinitas is dedicated to empowering Latina youth using media and technology. Girls in Latinitas’ summer camp learn a variety of skills including graphic design, audio recording, and coding. This helps to ensure new and diverse voices in media and technology in the future. IBM and all Offering Managers in the bootcamp quickly rallied around Latinitas’ mission statement, and we were eager to help. Before we showed up, the thought of facing a classroom full of teenage girls was a tad intimidating. What if they don’t like us or don’t care enough to talk to us? Will they relate to us? Luckily, my fears were dissipated by the welcoming atmosphere at Latinitas. Of course, bringing pizzas helped us, too. The girls at Latinitas prepared for their podcast recording session ahead of time, asking us questions like: “What do you like about your jobs at IBM?” and “How did IBM and NASA work together to give rockets a brain?” We shared personal stories about how each one of us landed in technology, hoping to empower young girls to make good decisions and acquire useful skills in school. IBMers sat in a circle, taking turns sharing our professional and personal experiences. The Latinitas girls handed a mic from one person to another effortlessly. Clearly they knew what they were doing, and the girls were adorable. I was impressed by their ability to communicate and interact with a roomful of strangers. Toward the end of the session, we turned the mic to the Latinitas girls by asking them questions like “Which social media platform is trending for teenagers these days?” “How do you spend your free time?” and “What do you wish to do in the future?” One third grade girl aspires to join the FBI just like her sister. Her friend, a fifth grader, wants to become a private detective. I have no doubt that there will be successful FBI agents and private detectives among the girls at Latinitas. Perhaps one day, they will use technology to catch bad guys and do good for the world. We need more women in technology, and I’m proud to work for a company led by a female CEO — Ginni Rometty. This experience reminded me why I got into the technology field in the first place. More importantly, I am proud to work for a company that lives and breathes innovation and celebrates diversity. -- -- Stories from the practice of design at IBM Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*zb5hYErrSUKFQJehTJowig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*5-8K_lY2WE3KP-XoJs4lkg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*5-8K_lY2WE3KP-XoJs4lkg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*5-8K_lY2WE3KP-XoJs4lkg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*zb5hYErrSUKFQJehTJowig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*zb5hYErrSUKFQJehTJowig.jpeg"
https://medium.com/@AhanM/product-review-fitbod-a-health-and-fitness-app-297eb678fb0c?source=tag_archive---------77-----------------------,Product Review: Fitbod,Written by Ahan Mukhopadhyay,Ahan Mukhopadhyay,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ahan Mukhopadhyay Follow -- Listen Share I am going to be reviewing the very popular health and fitness mobile app: Fitbod. It is trending on Apple app store with a 4.8 rating with over 56k reviews and also placed at #57 on the health & fitness category. Before I begin I want to say that the reason I was looking for a health and fitness app is that I really wanted to be able to track the amount of weight I was lifting to ensure I was making good progress over time. There are plenty of workout tracking apps but the primary reason I chose Fitbod initially was because of the option to personalize workout routines to my needs. The reason I’ve been so obsessed with using Fitbod is because of the action-reward cycle that it established around my workouts. Additionally, it gave me an accurate quantitative way of tracking how my strength or fitness improved. The habit-forming phenomenon in Fitbod is explained in detail in The One Fitness App That Hooked Me For Good. As I understand it Fitbod’s core value proposition is being able to provide users quick and personalized fitness routines and track their workouts. There are certainly a lot of competitors in this space so let’s see what differentiates Fitbod in comparison. These are some features that really make Fitbod stand out: Here’s what could be improved: Problem: One mistake that Fitbod makes is that it attempts to sign up the user before they even fully understand the core value of the product. Yes, there is a skip button at the top-right but it is quite easy to miss and when most users are faced with a big sign up form they feel like they’re compelled to fill it up and submit or they’re blocked from continuing. Solution: The fact is that Fitbod does allow the user to try the app without signing up but they won’t know unless they actually press Skip. So instead if Fitbod could just postpone the sign up page until after the first workout it would drastically help increase the user activation rate. This is because the user is a lot more likely to want to sign up when they do have a clear idea what they stand to gain from it. Problem: While learning about a new user, Fitbod asks what the main reason is for the user to download the app. The problem here is that the users are forced to choose only one reason for why they decided to get the app. Solution: However, having a ranking of all the applicable reasons for a user to download the app could prove to be a much more useful metric. By adding in this feature they only slightly increase the user input time but definitely improve information they collect about users and their problems. Problem: Another minor issue I found was that after completing a workout, Fitbod displays a bunch of achievements that you earned and displays statistics such as calories burned and total weight lifted among others. One of these metrics is “volume” and I wasn’t sure what that metric indicated. Solution: That’s why I think having an information panel on all the metrics or achievements being tracked could be useful to the user that is trying to make sense of the data that is presented. Here are some of my ideas for features that could be added in the future: I’m going to continue using Fitbod in the coming weeks and I’ll be continuously updating this post with my new findings. I’d imagine the personalized workout feature will become more prominent the more I use the app and I’m excited to find out just how useful it is. I encourage you to download the app yourself and share with me what you found useful and not so useful about this product. -- -- I write about personal and professional growth.

https://medium.com/coprocure/its-all-custom-5b0680d59f85?source=tag_archive---------71-----------------------,It’s all custom,CoProcure is making it easy for public servants to collaborate on contracting using custom elements and events,Sean Briar,No Author URL,N/A,7 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sean Briar Follow -- Listen Share As a technical intern with CoProcure, I’ve learned a lot about public procurement. Governments spend 1 of every 3 of our taxpayer dollars buying goods and services. To spend these public funds, governments must purchase using contracts that have been established through competitive bidding. Most of the 89K+ local U.S. governments generate their own contracts, even though they purchase similar things. Instead of generating their own contracts, these governments can legally collaborate on purchasing by sharing contracts, a process known as cooperative purchasing. Contracts from national and regional purchasing groups, states, and local agencies can be shared with local governments. However, since these contracts are not published or published across separate websites, a major challenge for public servants wishing to share contracts is that shareable contracts are hard to find. CoProcure is creating a central place where local governments can find shareable public contracts. So far, we’ve created a database of over 50,000 public contracts from governments across the country. (Learn how we did it.) We hope that this database will save governments time and money. As we’ve been building CoProcure, we’ve also considered: what’s the best way to share this data with those who need it? How can we meet our users, in this case public procurement staff, on tools and websites they’re already using? To help public servants find CoProcure, we built a search widget that can be added to any website. By including this widget on their websites, governments can allow their users to access the entire CoProcure contracts database; users can conduct a search and see results in just seconds without ever visiting CoProcure.us. Our default widget’s code is also a11y verified. Our score of 100 on the lighthouse accessibility audit will assure governments can rest assured knowing that the embedded CoProcure search experience will meet their site’s standard accessibility requirements. Our development team used custom elements to create the search widget. Custom elements allow you to build unique HTML elements that can have custom functionality using JavaScript. There are a lot of cool things you can do with Custom Elements. (This is a great resource for learning more.) “One of the key features of the Web Components standard is the ability to create custom elements that encapsulate your functionality on an HTML page, rather than having to make do with a long, nested batch of elements that together provide a custom page feature.” — MDN How you use custom elements depends on the project and developer (hence the “Custom”), but here is a look at how CoProcure implemented this technology: As you can see, creating custom elements can be as simple as declaring the element as we did here on line 12 of index.js, adding a few features, and then using your element as you would any other HTML tag. Here on line 4 of dev.html, we added our custom element to our HTML along with our other tags. Because our search widget functionality is in the custom element ‘coprocure-search,’ we just need a basic HTML structure and our element to get the results we want. Here’s why CoProcure decided to build a search widget using custom elements: Custom elements are fast. We achieve the important safety state of combining all of our JavaScript, CSS, and HTML inside our custom element without a lot of bulky weight that comes along with a framework such as Vue.js or React. Since there isn’t much to load, we can reduce load times. The size of our search widget, with all templates and interactivity, is 9KB gzipped. If you start with something like create-react-app, you get a bundle quadruple that size even before you start writing any of your application code. Building with custom elements instead of using a bulky framework is also good for our government partners. The last thing CoProcure wants to do is inconvenience our partners with bulky code that could significantly slow down their website load times and negatively impact the experience of their users. With custom elements, we can make sure we’re not bogging down the loading times of the pages hosting our search widget. We only have what we need to make the widget function. All of our JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is contained within our new component, so our search widget won’t interfere with other functionalities on the host site. Our host sites can put the element onto their webpage, wherever they want, just by including the new custom element HTML tag: coprocure-search. Not only does this make maintenance a breeze, makes it easier for others to digest the code and contribute to the project. It’s lightweight, compact, and cute. 💁 Because we are building directly on web platform standards, there was no need to learn any library specific APIs. All the code we’ve written is standard JavaScript that will be supported by browsers for years to come. One of the coolest aspects of programming and web development is being able to experiment with fun technologies and learn the fastest, most efficient ways to build what you need. While there are a lot of awesome libraries and APIs out there, sometimes you need not look any further than plain JavaScript. Today, our search widget is live on two sites: the Mid-America Regional Council’s Kansas City Regional Purchasing Cooperative, which serves government users in the Kansas City metro region, and the National Institute of Government Procurement (NIGP) Columbia Chapter, which serves governments in the Portland, OR metro area. It’s easy to add the CoProcure search widget to your page, too! Another unique aspect of the CoProcure search widget is our implementation of custom events to carry out some of our user interaction functionality. Custom events are very similar to custom elements, except they’re events. They use JavaScript’s built in CustomEvent constructor, and can be used to add data to the event among other things. Learn more about custom events here. Here’s a snippet of how we used a custom event for the search widget: You can see that we’ve declared a variable called event and used the CustomEvent constructor function to create a new element with all the data specific to our project. In this second image, we’ve added our new event to the DOM, which runs the getResults function on line 13. For streamlined functionality, we wrapped our event listener in a helper function that fires when the search widget custom element is loaded. You can actually see this helper function in action on line 14 of the very first image in this article. Similar to the custom elements described above, custom events are a platform standard. They’re written using JavaScript without the use of any libraries or frameworks, and are a simple way to communicate between modules. In addition, custom events are perfect for small apps such as the search widget because the data transfer ability allows just enough functionality for optimum data flow without a lot of extra work. Coupling the lightweight functionality of custom elements with the adaptability of custom events, CoProcure’s created a fast, efficient, and user-friendly search tool. With this search widget, public procurement staff can instantly access our database of public contracts from the websites they already visit. Sharing public contracts saves government time and taxpayer dollars; by providing public servants with more information about the work that’s already been done across the country, we hope to help public servants make more frequent and better use of these shareable contracts.

CoProcure is an early stage venture-backed startup optimizing local public procurement by helping local governments share contracts. Competitively-bid contracts in our marketplace can be reused by government buyers, saving time and taxpayer dollars and reducing the cost of selling to governments for businesses. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*c86ClcV4t7f8C-LQ., https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*c86ClcV4t7f8C-LQ., https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*c86ClcV4t7f8C-LQ."

We have been finding out.",Keele University,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Keele University Follow Keele University -- 5 Listen Share Gemma Briggs from The Open University; Dr. Helen Wells, Keele University, and Dr Leanne Savigar, Keele University write for The Conversation The retired football star David Beckham recently received a six-month driving ban after being photographed using his hand-held phone while driving. Unfortunately, Beckham is not alone in apparently thinking that time spent driving can also be usefully spent doing something else. But it isn’t just phones that can distract us while driving. Increasingly, vehicles come pre-installed with technology that promises to improve our lives and let us get that little bit more productivity out of our journey — be it digital assistants such as Alexa or parking assist systems. Many such technologies are designed to keep us safe, but could they actually be dangerous — giving us a false impression that our attention can be focused elsewhere? We have been finding out. Interestingly, most drivers seem to support the view that hand-held phone use is risky, as it involves the driver potentially taking their hands off the wheel. They also know it is illegal. The problem is that many drivers still continue to use their phones “handsfree” behind the wheel, because the law allows them to do so providing their hands are on the wheel. This implies it is a safe alternative. But research clearly shows that the driving behaviour and crash risk of a phone-using driver (whether that is hand-held or hands-free) is similar to, and sometimes worse than, that of a drunk driver. Our research has shown that phone use carries a significant cost to a driver’s attention, making them far more prone to errors, including failures in visual perception and inability to detect and react to hazards. The real problem with phone use is the cognitive demands it places on a driver. If we try to allocate attention to another engaging task at the same time as driving, our performance in both tasks suffers. We are continually introducing more technologies to our vehicles. Drivers can now ask Alexa or Google assistant a question, listen to text messages read aloud by the vehicle and use voice commands to initiate phone calls. All of this tech also works on the assumption that if it’s only your voice you are using, there are no safety implications. This is problematic as a wealth of research demonstrates that this kind of “infotainment” technology actually causes some of the distraction that contributes to driver error. Driving is complex and fast-paced, requiring the processing of information from multiple inputs, yet often we are made to feel as though it is easy. But demands on attention when driving vary from minute to minute, meaning any focus allocated elsewhere is a precious resource which may not be available when the driver faces an unexpected event. Listening to music, however, is less of a problem as it isn’t interactive in the same way as other technologies. As failure at the wheel can have devastating consequences, it is unsurprising that the idea of technological solutions to mitigate driver error are also becoming more common. It’s likely that Beckham’s Bentley has (at the very least) ABS, parking-assist, reversing sensors and lane-keeping technology. Such technology has led to a trend in advertising that encourages a belief that our modern cars can pretty much drive themselves. The European parliament recently announced that, from 2022, all new cars should be fitted with intelligent speed assistance (ISA), along with other safety features designed to alert drivers to distraction and drowsiness. But will these technologies increase safety, or could they encourage further distraction? Clearly, drivers are not great at respecting speed limits, so it may seem like a good idea to aim to take the choice of whether to speed or not out of our hands. To make something “techno-fixable” though, you need to reduce complex driving behaviour to dichotomies of “safe” and “dangerous”. Technology needs to be told which behaviour triggers which response in simple, binary terms as it cannot (yet) handle ifs and buts and context. But the risk is that this may encourage us to believe that 30mph, for example, is inherently safe, even when 20mph, or even less, might have been the safer choice. This is something we would like to explore further in our research. Likewise, tech that warns a driver if they are showing signs of drowsiness or intoxication, and parks their car for them if they don’t respond correctly, could actually encourage drivers to think that they can drive when unfit because the car will step in and save them. Technology can be marketed as improving safety, but safety requires understanding — not dichotomies. We know that a driver with their hands obligingly at the “ten and two position” can nonetheless be dangerously distracted. Yet we are continually introducing technologies to our vehicles that are distracting. Sadly, we can’t be sure that manufacturers are motivated by selling safety, as opposed to a version of safety that sells. At a time when we are no longer seeing year-on-year reductions in the number of people being killed or seriously injured on our roads, it seems clear that something radical needs to be done to get drivers’ focus back onto the driving task itself — and to challenge the perception that getting from A to B is a good opportunity to indulge in catching up on a bit of C. -- -- 5 Located in the Staffordshire countryside 🌳 Britain’s best university, as ranked by students (Student Crowd Awards, 2022) 🐿️ Many, many squirrels.

We expect anywhere from 500k-1M women to complete this quiz by the end of 2019. That’s a lot of bras. At Knix we have given ourselves the mission to reinvent intimates for real life. This means swapping out underwire for patent bonded technology. Ditching the sports bra double-up for the cutting edge in bounce tech. Our bras pack a punch when it comes to improving women’s lives through technology. Building this quiz is another way we’re getting more women into comfortable bras. I’ve challenged myself to have my work online meet the standard our products have set IRL: be an industry leader, all while keeping the customer as the focus. Before launching our quiz we realized we had a UX problem. Our sizing was confusing. Let me rephrase: bra sizing is confusing. There is an unfortunate amount of math involved in calculating your bra size.(Add in some causal body-dysmorphia from years of media body shaming and quickly one gives up and stays in that bra your mom bought at Target 6 years ago.) We knew we had a great product, but we knew sizing was getting in the way. Our CEO decided we needed to build a quiz to help customers figure out your size, without the math. She also decided to leverage our awesome model diversity so once you’ve been recommended a size we show you the product in the model closest to your size on all of our bra pages. Let’s get you in the right size and make sure you feel great about your body the whole time. So how did we solve an issue about boobs? We used people with boobs. #NothingAboutUsWithoutUs In building our quiz we sourced support from The Working Group (TWG) who brought forward a powerhouse all women team of a project manager, an account manager, a developer and a designer. The folks at TWG brought some killer expertise to the project and helped us think through the complexities of a 9 question quiz (which has 952,000 different possible response combinations). When TWG passed off the designs and code we made updates that fell out of the initial scope of the project and ran internal quality assurance. Our developers (two women, one man) crushed the integration tasks and had the quiz looking and feeling as a part of our site in no time (thanks in part to some very clean code from TWG developer Jazz). For QA we pulled together a rag tag group of folks from all our departments to try and break this thing before our customers could (eight women, one man). Then we refined it even more. And then we went live! Then we refined it even more and we’ll keep refining it as we listen to our customers and hear what they think about it and how they engage with it. When we hear about “women in tech” we so often picture a lonely meek woman in a room full of men talking over her and while this isn’t a story about toppling the tech industry’s deeply entrenched sexism, it is a story that might show you the tides are turning and women hold a seat at the table.

This transaction would be a little different than any other Craigslist sale I’ve been a party to. Sure, the stakes were a lower (I was only asking for $35) but it was all digital. There would be no face-to-face meeting to complete the transaction. I would email or text the ticket and someone would Venmo me the funds. Alas, Kathleen missed her window. Joseph responded first — I sent him the ticket and my Venmo link. This is a riskier move in the land of Craigslist, but we had exchanged Instagram handles and this was, after all, a Hozier show. Our online identities helped assuage scammer concerns and I’m sure Hozier would not approve of any impropriety. While I’m bummed that I couldn’t get to Sac for the show (a Monday night show out of town was overly ambitious) I’m happy to report that the transaction went just fine. Four days earlier, I made the decision to sell a large shelving unit in my office and replace it with a hulking buffet I had in storage. In less than 24 hours, I had collected my $220, handed Kyle the baggy of hardware, watched him drive off with my shelf miraculously piled in his already-full truck bed, then bounded back up the stairs to my office. Craigslist has been around for so long and been such a consistent pillar of the interwebz that it only dawned on me recently (and seemingly out of nowhere) that it wasn’t always there. It’s the place to go for affordable dining room chairs and Spanish Colonial apartments and Honda Ridgelines. I don’t clearly recall the first time I used it but I think it was my Crown Heights apartment in college in 2004. I know my motley crew of roommates found our feral kittens, Chloe Kate Moss & Oscar Madonna, on there a few months later. Craigslist seeped into our browsers in the early aughts and became a go-to for apartments and cars and relatively good-condition furniture from local human beings. It’s a mainstay in a digital world that evolves so quickly, there are epochs that already feel like the dark ages. Craigslist hasn’t changed much since it launched. It’s a comforting lo-fi interface that’s as functional as it is familiar. It’s like your favorite pizza parlor in your hometown run by the same family with divine eggplant parm and a pinball machine (looking at you, Pizza Town). My point is I’ve been taking it for granted, like I bet you have, and it’s time we put some proper respect on it. Craigslist is the shit. Craigslist was founded by Craig Newmark in 1995 as a way to connect to people in his new home of San Francisco. It started as an events site with the ethos of ‘people helping one another in friendly, social, and trusting communal ways’ and grew by popular demand to include job postings and beyond. Jim Buckmaster joined in 2000 as lead programmer and CTO and eventually CEO, and Craigslist came to NY and other cities and continued to spread it’s simple, effective gospel around the growing internet. Nineteen years later, a crew of about 40 people, headed by Buckmaster, operate the still-booming site, the leading classified service of any medium, anywhere in the world. It generates hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue annually, is worth upward of 3 billion dollars, and, if my recent successful transactions are any indication, shows no sign of stopping. The size and scope of current Craigslist was not the goal of anti-establishment founder Craig. It’s been an astronomical success that has created one of the best and most ubiquitous examples of tech-for-good that I can think of. A lot of horror stories go around about scams and psychopaths, but as they point out on the site, a staggeringly low number of violent crimes are committed compared with the 80 million monthly visitors. I have met a few douche bags in my long history on there (generally dudes with aliases like Shmee Gollum who complain that I’m asking exorbitant prices) but overall, people are good. The man with Texas plates who picked up the shelving unit said, “Might there be a time I can come by that wouldn’t excessively disturb you?” The couple I bought my gorgeous giant cabinet from helped haul it downstairs to my friend’s waiting truck. The guy who ended up buying the standing desk was a school administrator who paid for the desk out of his own pocket. I hung out all afternoon with the guy who bought my film SLR camera in 2008. What would we have done with these things without Craigslist? How would we find good homes for the treasures we no longer want, need, or have room for? Would we rely only on Wayfair and Amazon for the cheap convenience and send everything else to the dump? Salvation Army can only handle so much, Craigslist is probably keeping tons of our stuff out of landfills. It appeals to the environmentalist in me that Craigslist is an enduring vehicle of sustainability as our stuff finds new, enthusiastic custodians. It appeals to the treasure hunter in me that we can find strange and unique things, like this Kingdom mirror that is a siren call to the primordial-mirror-troll in all of us. It appeals to the human in me to see how people part with their things, how they live, where they come from and where they’re going. Something about the classic interface and the philosophy of the founders brings out the human in people online. Seeing what people devolve into with the anonymity of many comments sections, I recognize this is something sort of precious and rare. Craigslist isn’t interested in further monetizing its traffic. From what I’ve read, it doesn’t seem as if it will ever change. They are able to provide grants to a lot of great non-profits, help people in 70 countries find homes and jobs and shelves. It plays a role in aspects in our lives momentous and mundane. It’s pretty wonderful. As I look out at the waning moon from my beloved home (found on Craigslist) and return a book to my favorite cabinet (another Craigslist find), I can’t help but feel awash in gratitude for the phenomenon of this site and the people who keep it simple, functional, and thoughtful. It’s heartening that they’ve been so successful, and it makes me think there are a great many more opportunities for tech that connects us and provides us opportunities to show up for each other in ‘friendly, social, and trusting communal ways’. We can be human on the internet. Will we? -- -- A thinking thot.

That is because Drill caters to very specific use cases, it’s very niche. But when used, it can make significant differences to the way you interact with data. First, let’s see what Apache Drill is, and then how we can connect our MongoDB data source to Drill and easily query data. According to their website, Apache Drill is “Schema-free SQL Query Engine for Hadoop, NoSQL and Cloud Storage.” That’s pretty much self-explanatory. So, Drill is a tool to query Hadoop, MongoDB, and other NoSQL databases. You can write simple SQL queries that run on the data stored in other databases, and you get the result in a row-column format. The best part is you can even query Apache Kafka and AWS S3 data with this. Let’s see how we can connect to MongoDB and query some data. To test out Apache Drill on your local machine, you only need to download the compressed file, extract it, and run a shell script. And you’re ready to go. You can download Apache Drill from here. Once you extract the file you just downloaded, cd into the bin directory and run the following command to run the embedded Drill service: You’ll get a prompt similar to the following: You’re now running Apache Drill on your local machine. Now let’s connect it to our local MongoDB instance. Open your internet browser and go to http://localhost:8047. This is the Apache Drill web UI. From here, you can configure storage (connections), run SQL queries, and change configurations. For now, head over to the Storage tab. Here, you’ll find two lists. The first list to the left contains the storage plugins, or connections, that are enabled. To the right, you’ll see plugins which are disabled. You’ll see MongoDB to the right, in the disabled list. Enable the MongoDB plugin and it’ll be added to the left list. The page should look something like this: You can edit the MongoDB connection string from here if you are not using the default port or want to connect to a remote MongoDB instance. After enabling this plugin, we’ll switch back to the command line interface to run some sample queries. Before we begin, if you haven’t got any sample data to work with, you can easily generate thousands of records using a Java tool that I wrote. The code is here on Github. Before we start querying MongoDB with Drill, let’s take a look at our sample dataset. I have generated 20,000 documents with random values, a subset of that data is here: As you can see, the data makes no sense. Now, getting the same dataset from MongoDB using Apache Drill is as simple as the most basic SQL query: But before this, let’s look at a few other queries. Run the following query to list all the databases that you have access to. Note that you are not limited to only MongoDB databases, but databases from all the storage plugins that are currently enabled. I have my sample data loaded into a collection in the “mongo.dill” database. So let’s use that: Let’s now see what tables we have in this database: Now, we run the select query to list our data: That’s pretty much it. You can now start experimenting with much complex queries with the data you have. -- -- 2 Analytics Vidhya is a community of Generative AI and Data Science professionals.

PCMag Follow PC Magazine -- Listen Share Google Stadia is the newest cloud-based gaming service, but it isn’t alone. We look at how it compares to Nvidia’s GeForce Now and Sony’s PlayStation Now. By Will Greenwald Google’s new Stadia streaming service doesn’t stream movies or TV shows: It streams video games that run on Google’s own servers and are accessible on phones, tablets, Google Chrome, and Chromecast Ultra. Just plug in or pair a controller with your device of choice to play assorted console and PC-quality games. Stadia isn’t the only service of its kind, though. The game streaming field began nearly a decade ago with OnLive. That service no longer exists, but a few current services let you play your favorite games remotely. Nvidia’s GeForce Now uses Nvidia’s servers to run PC games, which are then sent to any compatible Windows PC, Mac, or Nvidia Shield device. It supports hundreds of games, and can be integrated with parts of your Steam library. PlayStation Now is Sony’s cloud gaming system, and it’s understandably very PlayStation-focused. It works on the PlayStation 4 or any compatible PC, and features hundreds of games from the PS2, PS3, and PS4. Stadia, GeForce Now, and PlayStation Now are our main contenders, but we want to also mention the Shadow service, available through the Shadow Ghost box. Instead of simply streaming games, it provides full access to a high-end Windows 10 system, letting you install any games from any compatible digital store to play at your leisure. It’s a powerful service, though at $25 per month it’s also much more expensive than the other game streaming services; it’s also limited to certain parts of the country. How games look and sound are two of the most important parts of the game-streaming experience (though not the most important part, which I’ll explain below). These services need to take graphics rendered on servers miles away and send them, along with synchronized audio, to your device of choice. Picture Netflix, but instead of playing a media file, it’s rendering graphics in real time based on what the game is doing. All three streaming services offer solid graphics, assuming you have a fast internet connection. They also can show fuzziness and artifacts if your speed dips for a moment. When all conditions are ideal, Stadia has the edge with support for games at up to 4K resolution, while GeForce Now and PS Now top out at 1080p. This is the most important part of game streaming. However your games look, you can’t play them if their response to your inputs lags for seconds after you enter them. Game-streaming services need to be able to accept your controller (or mouse and keyboard) inputs, process them through the game running on their servers, and then send the results back to your screen in only a few milliseconds, or they’ll feel muddy at best and unplayable at worst. All three streaming services have demonstrated excellent input speed, for the most part, and largely feel as responsive as if you were playing on local hardware-with one unfortunate exception. Playing Stadia on a Google Chromecast Ultra, using the Stadia controller wirelessly, produced input lag in our tests that ranged from awkward to unacceptable. Stadia is incredibly smooth on phones and in Chrome tabs, but using the Chromecast Ultra made aiming in Destiny 2 and blocking in Mortal Kombat 11 almost impossible. That might be why Stadia doesn’t support wireless controllers in any other use case; even with the Stadia controller on phone or PC, you need to use a wired connection. Hopefully this can be fixed with an update in the future. Good news for cheap PC owners! You can use all three gaming services. Just plug a compatible controller (the DualShock 4 and Xbox Wireless Controller both work with each service) into your PC and start playing through the associated app or Chrome tab. If you’re a Mac user, you can use Google Stadia or Nvidia GeForce Now, but PlayStation Now doesn’t have a Mac-compatible app yet. For mobile devices, Stadia is the way to go, but surprisingly it’s more friendly to iPhones than Android phones. On Android, Stadia works with the Pixel 2, 3, 3a, and 4, and the XL versions of each phone. Support for LG, OnePlus, and Samsung phones is planned, but won’t be available at launch. For GeForce Now, you’ll need to find a now-discontinued Shield Tablet if you want to play on mobile. With the PlayStation Vita long gone, PlayStation Now has no no compatible mobile platform. If you want to play streaming games on your TV, each service has its own method. Google Stadia works with the Chromecast Ultra, which at $70 is the most affordable and smallest way to stream games to your TV. Unfortunately, the lag means it’s also the worst. Nvidia GeForce Now can be used with the $150 Nvidia Shield TV, which worked much better in big-screen stream testing. If you have a PlayStation 4 you can play PlayStation Now games on your TV, but at that point you’ll have already spent $300 on a device that can play PS4 games without streaming (and download many PS2 and PS3 games without PS Now). On a monthly basis, you won’t have to spend more than $10 to stream games on any of these services (and in some cases, you might not have to pay anything). Google Stadia and PlayStation Now are both $9.99 per month. In Stadia’s case, that’s the Stadia Pro membership, which supports game streaming up to 4K and promises access to discounts and free games starting with Destiny 2: The Collection. Stadia will also offer a free Stadia Base membership that can stream games at up to 1080p and won’t have free games or discounts. Nvidia GeForce Now is a bit more complicated. It’s currently available as a closed “free beta” to which you can request an invitation, but it’s been available for $6.99 in previous beta phases. Then there’s the question of games. With the exception of Destiny 2, Stadia requires you to buy every game you want to play, apparently at retail price. GeForce Now includes some free games, and has the added advantage of letting you link your Steam account to play games you already own through the service. PlayStation Now simply offers access to hundreds of PlayStation games at a flat rate. The game purchasing issue is a potential problem for Google Stadia. If you spend $20 to $60 on a game, it is reasonable to assume that you then own that game, and will be able to play it as long as you have a device you can play it on. Since Stadia is a completely streaming-based system, there is no way to download, back up, or preserve a game you buy through it. This means if Stadia is ever discontinued, your purchases will evaporate. This is much less of a problem with GeForce Now, which works with Steam (where you can download games) and PlayStation Now (a Netflix-like subscription that doesn’t charge for individual games). You can’t play every PC or PlayStation game through streaming. A relatively small handful are available on these services, compared with the full range of PC and console games out there. Stadia’s handful is the smallest by far, consisting of just 12 games at launch and growing to less than 30 by year’s end. It’s not a very impressive collection, though it has some notable games like Red Dead Redemption 2. GeForce Now has several hundred games, mostly a few years old. There are a few newer standouts, though, like Devil May Cry V and Monster Hunter World, along with several long-running classics like DOTA 2, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, and The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. PlayStation Now has the biggest collection, but the fewest outright bangers. There’s every God of War game, the first three Uncharted games, five Ratchet and Clank games, nine Resident Evil games, 10 Lego games, and perhaps the weirdest game on the list, mediocre Japan-only Sega arcade fighting game Sonic the Fighters. It’s a lot of games, just not a lot that are less than four years old. That’s a tough question, probably because streaming games as a concept is still relatively new and a bit unpolished. You need to be in the unique position of being enthusiastic about video games and possessing a fast internet connection, but not already having a solid gaming PC or console on which you would already be playing these games locally. Google Stadia would be the most powerful service, considering its very wide platform support and excellent performance, but too many limitations hold it back. Its library is microscopic, it requires a wired controller to work well, and the only way to play it on a TV (without running an HDMI cable from your phone or PC) doesn’t work very well. PlayStation Now is worth a subscription for a month every so often, just to play around with a wide selection of PlayStation games you might not have thought about in a while.

Initially only producing small solar lighting systems, M-KOPA has since broadened its solar home system (SHS) portfolio and now provides solar power to over 760,000 homes across Africa. All of this is managed through an in-house, pay-as-you-go financing platform. A five-minute walk north of M-KOPA will bring you to the regional offices of Greenlight Planet — the market leader for off-grid solar products in Kenya. When Greenlight Planet launched over 10 years ago, their goal was to replace kerosene lanterns with efficient, pico-solar lamps. Now, they’ve expanded their offerings and customer portfolio to serve those with a household income of 2–3 USD per day to a household income of 2–10 USD per day. They’ve also added customers who have the option to connect to the grid, highlighting a move beyond strictly off-grid contexts. As both companies continue to improve their product line and expand their offerings, one challenge remains clear: what’s the best strategy to get the price-point and design right for appliances paired with their SHSs? While Greenlight Planet isn’t new to developing products, Radhika Thakkar, Vice President of Corporate Affairs at Greenlight Planet, says that one of their special ingredients for optimizing product design is the willingness to partner with other manufacturers and distributors who have a better knowledge of certain markets and products. This allows them to gather knowledge and move more deliberately and thoughtfully. While home energy remains their focus, productive-use appliances like solar water pumps, solar mills, and cookstoves provide a likely opportunity for partnership, says Radhika. For M-KOPA, getting the right price, size, and efficiency of products has been a process of trial-and-error. In their off-grid simulated house, a 24-inch TV demonstrated the intricate balance between meeting the customer’s price ceiling and matching the maximum picture quality to the efficiency necessary to run with the system. While SHS kits with lighting and a TV are M-KOPA’s bread-and-butter, the range of products they offer may soon change. According to Daniel Schroeder, Director of Market Development, the team has also been working to develop an off-grid refrigerator. In 2017, M-KOPA began field research to determine the appropriate refrigerator size for their system. Based on how much consumers were loading the refrigerators, the team chose to deploy samples of a 50 L refrigerator in the field for user testing. Even though the refrigerators were sized correctly for the load-case, their design did not meet consumers’ expectations for what a refrigerator should look like, with many saying it looked like a toy. “Sometimes you get it wrong”, says Daniel “but you have to be brave.” In turn, M-KOPA launched a 100 L refrigerator in 2018 to better meet these expectations, and despite the size, it’s still typically only loaded halfway. This exemplifies the complex challenges associated with developing products for a nascent and sometimes misunderstood market and, says Daniel, the value of R&D assistance to help companies better understand their customers. Beyond developing highly-efficient and affordable products necessary for this market, consumer research can be key to help companies inform and improve product design. “All of this is very experimental”, says Radhika of Greenlight Planet, “we’re just looking at what our customers need.” Greenlight Planet advises on the Technical Working Group for refrigerators and solar water pumps, M-KOPA competed in the 2017 Global LEAP Awards for Off-Grid Televisions, and both companies have several products quality-verified through Lighting Global Quality Assurance, all Efficiency for Access initiatives. Throughout 2019, Efficiency for Access will release a suite of market, consumer, technology, and impacts research. Our latest publication in Springer’s Energy Efficiency journal highlights key findings from off-grid refrigerator testing data and synthesizes important consumer perspectives and our Refrigerator Technology Roadmap charts a course of action for improving fridge affordability and energy efficiency.

Explosive data, Quantum Computing, and business use that even Hollywood couldn’t dream up to put the AI winter to an end. This is Part 3 of a 4-part series on “4 Questions About AI You’ve Always Wanted to Ask”. Visit AITruth.org to see the rest of the series and subscribe. Next week’s post is “Part 4: Why do businesses want AI? What are they using it for?” AI research has roots back to 1954 and received big funding in the 1960’s due to interest from the US Department of Defense. Like all technologies, AI has had hype cycles with fluctuating levels of interest and funding. There are three basic reasons why AI has made a comeback recently. First, there is a whole lot more data in the world now. We live our lives as digital, social media beings and that leaves a great variety of rich data behind as a by-product. Even the somewhat antiquated healthcare system has finally seen a transition to the digital age with Electronic Medical Records of patients plus new collective doctor diagnostic systems which allow for sharing of data amongst doctors — when agreed by patients. There is new genomic data thanks to the popularity of genetic testing for ancestral heritage. Social media data and geo-tracking data are growing exponentially thanks to Google, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, What’s App, LinkedIn, Instagram and Snap Chat. The Internet of Things or connected devices is creating billions of bytes of data doing everything from detecting maintenance needs in oil rigs to ensuring your house stays safe, sound and a cozy temperature. Retailers are collecting buyer behavior data from apps you have downloaded for convenience or rewards like Starbucks, Amazon, Walmart and Target. There are slews of services apps that you are using that are creating data profiles as well such as: banking, matchmaking, ovulation tracking, apartment/house finding/evaluating, financial advisement, gaming. Just look at your smartphone right now. All of those apps are collecting data about you either directly or from geo-tracking on your phone or pictures you have taken or all of the above. Not to mention companies are monetizing their existing data or augmenting their data to develop data sets specifically for use with potential business partners’ AI systems. For example, fitness tracker groups are combining their data with other health data via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to allow more insight into healthy habits like working out plus nutrition for weight loss goals. While another group is tagging pictures of specific crops at different levels of ripeness so that farmers who own specific robotic harvesting tractors can delineate right there in the field which ones are spoiled and which crops are good. In this new AI era, data and the training of the algorithms is where the differentiation will come not the algorithms themselves. Hence, why I spend so much time explaining all the possible data sources so you can see for yourselves how diverse and big the data opportunities are in the AI space. Second, the computing power is exponential with new quantum capabilities paired with data storage — which has gotten more efficient and down-right cheap. For the first time in history, computing power, the ability to crunch through all of the data is actually keeping up with ambitions for AI systems. Though those who train the algorithms will complain that it is still taking weeks instead of hours, but the computing power is evolving quickly. Fun fact, when IBM’s Watson first came on the scene with Jeopardy back in 2010, the computing hardware took up a huge room and could do a lot less crunching at the same time. As of 2017, the same tech was the size of three pizza boxes and it just continues to go down with the introduction of each new chip. Third, more businesses are jumping in with more applications of AI than ever before, thanks in no small part to the large variety of data available now that wasn’t available in the past. Government armed forces and intelligence groups have always been interested in AI. Banks have had need for machine learning aspects of AI as long as hackers and fraud have been around. But more recently insurance firms, manufacturing groups, large technology companies, media and entertainment firms, oil and gas companies, retailers, automotive companies, have all come up with inventive ways to leverage AI in their businesses. IBM had a log of over 150 different use cases in almost every single industry on the planet; and that was back in 2015. Next week’s article will be: “Why do businesses want AI?

https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-design-patterns-0-introduction-5e88cfff6792?source=tag_archive---------157-----------------------,Flutter Design Patterns: 0 — Introduction,Flutter Community,Mangirdas Kazlauskas,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Home Newsletter About  Articles and Stories from the Flutter Community  Mangirdas Kazlauskas Follow Flutter Community -- 10 Listen Share Hi, I am Mangirdas, a software engineer and Flutter enthusiast from Lithuania. I have been following the Flutter journey since its version of 0.10.2 but realized that I have not contributed to the Flutter community, yet. So I am more than intrigued to introduce a new article series — Flutter Design Patterns. In the series, I will do my best to describe OOP design patterns, their implementation in Dart programming language and appliance when developing applications using Flutter. Update 2022–09–15: I moved this blog to my personal website. For a better reading experience, up to date articles, interactive code examples and some extra content FOR FREE, check kazlauskas.dev. In each article of the series, I will overview a design pattern, implement it using Dart programming language, prepare a practical (if possible) example in Flutter and add it to the Flutter Design Patterns mobile application. The theoretical part about design patterns would be heavily based on the “Gang of Four” (GoF) book “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software”, which, in my opinion, is one of the most iconic software engineering books about software design patterns. This book contains more than 20 different OOP design patterns, so you can expect more than 20 articles in the series! I will do my best to be consistent and publish a new article to the series weekly. Hmm, ok, maybe I have jumped straight to the point but did not explain what is this series about… OOP stands for “Object-Oriented Programming”. In simple words, it is a programming paradigm that uses the idea of objects to represent data and methods to manipulate that data. This idea lets software engineers write code that represents the real-world objects, the data they contain and their relations with other objects via corresponding code structures. If you have already written some code using Dart or any other OOP programming language (C#, C++, Java just to name a few), probably you saw and used classes, defined properties and/or methods inside of those classes, created class instances and operated with them, specified relations between different objects/classes — that’s nothing less than Object-Oriented programming! OOP design pattern is a typical solution to a common problem in software design. In the GoF book, the purpose of a design pattern is described like this: A design pattern names, abstracts, and identifies the key aspects of a common design structure that make it useful for creating a reusable object-oriented design. A software design pattern is not about solving specific UI/UX problems (as it could look from first sight by noticing the word design), it is more about the code structure which is like a blueprint to solve a particular object-oriented design problem, issue in your code. By applying these patterns, you can speed up the development process, write code that is more flexible, reusable. However, the most difficult part of these patterns is to understand the main idea behind them, to identify places in your code where these patterns could be applied and which problems could be resolved. But that’s what this series is all about — to introduce and provide the basics of several design patterns to help you choose the right one for your specific problem. As I have already mentioned, by introducing a new design pattern per article, I will also build a Flutter Design Patterns mobile application and expand its design patterns library step-by-step. Of course, this application is open-source and its code is already available on Github for all of you! The application consists only of three different screens — the main menu, design patterns’ category screen and design pattern’s screen. I hope you have noticed a little heartbeat animation in the main menu, as well as page transitions and content animations, which provide some dynamic to the application (I have spent a few hours implementing them, so, please, notice me senpai). To demonstrate how the application displays design patterns, I have created a new branch in the repository. I will not merge it to the master branch later (it is only for demonstration purposes), but by using these changes I will explain how a new design pattern could be (and will be!) added to the application. First of all, a new data object should be added to the assets/data/design_patterns.json containing information about the design pattern (id, title, description and route): Then a markdown file must be added to the assets/markdown folder with the same name as the previously set id in the design pattern’s JSON. This markdown would contain information about the design pattern — usually, code snippets with some explanation on how the pattern is implemented. After providing a markdown file, the design pattern should be implemented and its example widget for the design pattern’s screen should be prepared. For this example, I have created a simple Hello World widget (introduction.dart): Finally, a new route should be added to router.dart file by adding the route name to the DesignPatternRoutes class (it should match with the route value in the design pattern’s JSON file) and adding a new DesignPatternDetails widget with a previously created example (lines 25–32): That’s all! After these steps, a new design pattern is available in the Flutter Design Patterns library: If I have missed something, do not hesitate to ask or just check the code by yourself, it is open and free for use!

https://medium.com/@TesseractAcade1/why-affective-computing-and-mindless-ai-will-conquer-the-world-d7be88f1d561?source=tag_archive---------50-----------------------,Why affective computing and mindless AI will conquer the world,Written by The Tesseract Academy,The Tesseract Academy,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in The Tesseract Academy Follow -- 2 Listen Share By Dr. Stylianos Kampakis Affective computing is a term that refers to the synergy between AI and psychology in order to understand and affect emotions. Another term for it could be emotional AI. It is a niche within AI that is not very popular, but I really believe it is going to become increase in popularity in the near future. Until very recently, machine learning did not have many things to say about psychology. We, of course, had sentiment analysis but that’s that. In the last few years some companies tried to combine psychometrics with machine learning, in order to create improved psychometric questionnaires. However, I really believe that the advancements in affective computing and, what is now called mindless AI, are what is going to cause a potential paradigm shift. Affective computing was created as a term in the MIT Media Lab. Mindless computing was created as a term in Cornell University. The objective is the integration of human emotion, AI and psychology to improve any number of outcomes, from understanding our emotions better to improving communication with machines, as well as between us. The powerful idea behind mindless computing is that smart devices will affect our behaviour subconsciously. How is this possible? There is lots of research on “entrainment”, the concept that through the use of frequencies we can control brainwaves, heart rate and respiration. Brainwave entraiment is probably the most popular application of entrainment. Through the use of sound frequences, such as monaural or binaural beats, it is possible to force the brain to tune in a specific frequency. So, for example, if you are meditating, you might want to use frequencies that force your brain to tune in theta waves. Technology is moving forward in the integration of wearable sensors, and emotion recognition. For example, MyFeel has created a wearable device that is described as the “world’s first emotion sensor & mental health advisor”. Their wristband uses different sensors, including skin conductance, heart rate and skin temperature, in order to collect data which is then fed into an AI algorithm that can infer the user’s emotional state. LimbicAI is another company in that company with the mission to merge neuroscience, emotion and technology. They provide an SDK for stress recognition in apps. In order to do that, they utilise Apple Watch’s heart rate monitor. Pip is another device that can detect stress levels by using a special device on your fingertip. It does this by detecting variations in your electrodermal activity. You can then visualise this on a dashboard and become more aware of how different life events affect your stress levels and well-being. While recording all this information, such as heart rate, or stress levels, is very useful, what is even more powerful is the potential that these technologies unlock in communicating with ourselves and others. Through the use of intelligent assistant’s like Amazon’s Alexa, chatbots, smartphones, even robots, we will be able to receive feedback on our behaviour, become more mindful, and take actions to improve our well-being. What is very important is that for the first time we can record information at a very granular level. So, we can measure effects, and outcomes directly. Whereas in the past, the servicing of mental health took place through professionals, and was based on someone’s self-reporting, we can know add a great degree of objectivity, make it more personal (through the use of recommender systems), and more easily service large parts of the population, even those that do not find it easy to access mental health services. It is clear that progress in this area will move faster and faster, and we can only guess at some of the amazing products we will be seeing coming out in the next few years. We can see one hint at this direction from Within[U].ai. I have been personally involved in building this product whose goal is to integrate all the aforementioned product ideas and go much further. So far the page is a bit cryptic, but as you will read, Within[U] aims to build a complete map of human consciousness, and then put this inside a machine. Why would someone want to do that (other than the coolness factor?). This is the best to increase mindfulness of ourselves, and emotions, so the applications are countless. Feel free to get in touch if you want to know more (as currently the project is in stealth mode).

Carney Follow -- 1 Share I do not understand the hostility I see on Facebook from time to time towards self-checkout. I don’t know of any major retailers that have eliminated checkout lanes. In Shelbyville, Kroger and Walmart both offer you a choice. You can use self-checkout, or you can go through a traditional checkout lane. I don’t think that’s going to change any time soon. The major big-box chains are in a fierce competition, and they are trying to add more options, not fewer. They’ve added self-checkout, but they’ve also added ClickList, in which an employee does your shopping for you and brings your groceries out to your car, and home delivery options as well. It’s completely up to you. I find self-checkout, for the way I shop, to be much faster and more convenient. But I don’t begrudge anyone the right to go through a traditional checkout lane, and I use them myself in certain situations (a large, full basket, for example, or when buying a gift card which must be activated at the register). I feel no hostility towards traditional checkout lanes or the people using them — it’s a matter of personal preference, not a moral issue. “But wait,” some of you are saying. “It is a moral issue. Self-checkout lanes cost people jobs.” I would respond to that in several ways. -- -- 1 Author of “Dislike: Faith and Dialogue in the Age of Social Media,” available at http://www.lakeneuron.com/dislike Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*t9Ca4euSLJRnZTPl_pERUQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*t9Ca4euSLJRnZTPl_pERUQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*t9Ca4euSLJRnZTPl_pERUQ.jpeg"

You want to change to a different framework? Write a new adapter. You want to use a database, instead of storing data in files? Again, write an adapter for it. Draw a boundary around the business logic. The hexagon. Anything inside the hexagon must be free from technology concerns. The outside of the hexagon talks with the inside only by using interfaces, called ports. Same the other way around. By changing the implementation of a port, you change the technology. Isolating business logic inside the hexagon has another benefit. It enables writing fast, stable tests for the business logic. They do not depend on web technology to drive them, for example. Here’s an example diagram. It shows Spring MVC technology as boxes with dotted lines, ports and adapters as solid boxes, and the hexagon without its internals: An adapter translates between a specific technology and a technology free port. The PoemController adapter on the left receives requests and sends commands to the IReactToCommands port. The PoemController is a regular Spring MVC Controller. Because it actively uses the port, it's called a driver adapter. IReactToCommands is called a driver port. Its implementation is inside the hexagon. It's not shown on the diagram. On the right side, the SpringMvcPublisher adapter implements the IWriteLines port. This time, the hexagon calls the adapter through the port. That's why SpringMvcPublisher is called a driven adapter. And IWriteLines is called a driven port. I show you how to implement that application. We go all the way from a user story to a domain model inside the hexagon. We start with a simple version of the application that prints to the console. Then we switch to Spring Boot and Spring MVC. The company FooBars.io decides to build a Poetry App. The product owner and the developers agree on the following user story: As a reader I want to read at least one poem each day So that I thrive as a human being As acceptance criteria, the team agrees on: The developers meet and draw the following diagram: So the SimulatedUser sends commands to the IReactToCommands port. It asks for poems in English and German. Here's the code, it's available on Github. poem/simple/driver_adapter/SimulatedUser.java The IReactToCommands port has only one method to receive any kind of command. poem/boundary/driver_port/IReactToCommands.java AskForPoem is the command. Instances are simple, immutable POJOs. They carry the language of the requested poem. poem/command/AskForPoem.java And that’s it for the left, driver side of the hexagon. On to the right, driven side. When the SimulatedUser asks the IReactToCommands port for a poem, the hexagon: You can’t see Step 2 yet. It happens inside the hexagon, in the domain model. That’s the business logic of the example. So we focus on Step 1 and Step 3 first. In Step 1, the collection of poems is a language dependent, hard coded array. It’s provided by the HardcodedPoemLibrary adapter that implements the IObtainPoems port. poem/boundary/driven_port/IObtainPoems.java poem/simple/driven_adapter/HardcodedPoemLibrary.java In Step 3, the ConsoleWriter adapter writes the lines of the poems to the output device, i.e. the console. poem/boundary/driven_port/IWriteLines.java poem/simple/driven_adapter/ConsoleWriter.java We have created all the ports, and a simple implementation of all the adapters. So far, the inside of the hexagon remained a mystery. It’s up next. When a user asks for a poem, the system displays a random poem. Similar in the code: when the IReactToCommands port receives an AskForPoemcommand, the hexagon calls a DisplayRandomPoem command handler. The DisplayRandomPoem command handler obtains a list of poems, picks a random one and writes it to the output device. This is exactly the list of steps we talked about in the last clause. poem/boundary/internal/command_handler/DisplayRandomPoem.java It’s also the job of the command handler to translate between the domain model data and the data used in the port interfaces. In my implementation of a hexagonal architecture, there is only a single driver port, IReactToCommands. It reacts to all types of commands. The Boundary class is the implementation of the IReactToCommands port. It creates a behavior model using a library. The behavior model maps each command type to a command handler.  Then, a behavior dispatches the commands based on the behavior model. poem/boundary/Boundary.java The domain model of the example doesn’t have very interesting functionality. The RandomPoemPicker picks a random poem from a list. A Poem has a constructor that takes a String containing line separators, and splits it into verses. The really interesting bit about the example domain model: it doesn’t refer to a database or any other technology, not even by interface! That means that you can test the domain model with plain unit tests. You don’t need to mock anything. Such a pure domain model is not a necessary property of an application implementing a hexagonal architecture. But I like the decoupling and testability it provides. A final step remains to make the application work. The application needs a main class that creates the driven adapters. It injects them into the boundary.  It then creates the driver adapter, for the boundary, and runs it. poem/simple/Main.java And that’s it! The team shows the result to the product owner. And she’s happy with the progress. Time for a little celebration. The team decides to turn the poem app into a web application. And to store poems in a real database. They agree to use the Spring framework to implement it. Before they start coding, the team meets and draws the following diagram: Instead of a SimulatedUser, there is a PoemController now, that sends commands to the hexagon. poem/springboot/driver_adapter/PoemController.java When receiving a command, the PoemController calls springMvcBoundary.basedOn(webModel). This creates a new Boundary instance, based on the webModel of the request: poem/springboot/boundary/SpringMvcBoundary.java The call to reactTo() sends the command to the boundary, as before. On the right side of the hexagon, the SpringMvcPublisher adds an attribute lines to the Spring MVC model. That's the value Thymeleaf uses to insert the lines into the web page. poem/springboot/driven_adapter/SpringMvcPublisher.java The team also implements a PoemRepositoryAdapter to access the PoemRepository. The adapter gets the Poem objects from the database. It returns the texts of all poems as a String array. poem/springboot/driven_adapter/PoemRepositoryAdapter.java Finally, the team implements the Application class that sets up an example repository and plugs the adapters into the ports. And that’s it. The switch to Spring is complete. There are many ways to implement a hexagonal architecture. I showed you a straightforward approach that provides an easy to use, command driven API for the hexagon. It reduces the number of interfaces you need to implement. And it leads to a pure domain model. If you want to get more information on the topic, read Alistair Cockburn’s original article on the subject. The example in this article is inspired by a three part series of talks by Alistair Cockburn on the subject. Last edited July 30, 2021. Do you have a question? Chat with me on Gitter.

Maybe even more peaceful. For sports fans at least. Before the endless hours of sports radio and TV, social media spewing with hot takes from “experts” that you have never heard of, and blogs for every team in every league in every country, there was, well, not a lot. While the rules of the games, more or less, have remained the same over the past few decades, the ways that fans view, consume, and interact with their favorite team, athlete, or league have altered drastically. Gone are the days when television and radio were the only mediums for fans to catch “the game”, or the morning newspaper providing exclusive insight on all of the details one might have missed from the night before. And with this shift, came the departure of watching sports passively. 1. Infographic: The Future of Virtual Reality 2. Five Augmented Reality Uses That Solve Real-Life Problems 3. Expert View: 3 ways VR is transforming Learning & Development 4. Virtual Reality Headsets: What are the Options? Which is Right For You? Watching a sports game, match, or event was, for better or worse, a passive activity. Without the excessive amount of noise and content being continuously delivered through countless platforms, a sports fan had one clear objective: watch and enjoy the game. Previously, in most circumstances, your typical sports fan would make their way home at the end of the day, pour themselves their drink of choice, and settle down to watch the game that was being shown on national television. Since there was no NBA League Pass or NFL Sunday Ticket, everyone ended up viewing the same game; ultimately creating a nationally shared experience that just doesn’t occur frequently today. The announcer was the sports expert, and there was no mention of data analytics by internet bloggers noting the plus/minus of the ninth guy on the bench. And, once the game was over, that was it. Watching sports revolved around just that: watching sports. The viewing experience started and ended with the game. Sports fans were passionate and dedicated to their teams, but it was a hobby or a pastime. However, in the past decade, technology has turned sports into a lifestyle full of clicking, tweeting, posting, checking, and perhaps most notably, always watching. “Consumers are craving multi-screen experiences that enhance their favorite live sports” No longer do, we as fans, settle for watching and cheering for our teams during games. In 2019, we want to interact, engage, communicate, with our favorite teams and athletes through multiple devices and platforms. This is where the major shift has occurred as a fan. The sports viewing experience has become an active lifestyle; a hobby dictated by our urge to be caught up to the very moment on sports news and content. And the driving force behind our altering perception of sports: technology. Technology has changed almost everything about the life of an avid sports fans in the past few decades, and turned fandom into a 24/7 — which at this point may not even encapsulate how ever present sports are — news cycle, and ultimately, lifestyle. A lifestyle that can provide, for lack of a better term, a rollercoaster of emotions: Today, watching, interacting, and engaging with sports has never been easier. From notifications and YouTube highlights to video games and mock drafts, the sports industry has blossomed into machine that has turned passive fans into obsessive maniacs. To understand this shift from passive hobby to active obsession, we will examine the technologies that have enabled sports to consume the lives of fans. Streaming: Potentially the biggest shift in the way that sports are viewed is due to the exponential growth of online streaming. Before the launch of online streaming, fans had two choices for watching the game: buy expensive tickets to attend the event — not to mention long bathroom lines and traffic — or watch/listen to a broadcast of the game through TV or radio. However, through the distribution of online streaming (both legal and illegal), sports fans have instantaneous, affordable on-the-go access to local, national, and international sporting events. This leap in viewer experience has drastically altered how fans view games, and in turn, this alteration has made viewing sports a much more active event. With streaming capabilities via a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, fans no longer have to make it home for “the game”. Instead of pouring themselves their drink of choice and settling down to watch the game that is being shown through one or two mediums, fans have come to expect to be able to watch their favorite team or player at any time. Whether they are on the train, at the park, working out at the gym, fans have access to the games they want to watch. “That doesn’t change the apparent need for greater immediacy, though, as people move away from watching things in a specific room with a couch and a television to wherever they may be.” www.nytimes.com And this level of access and convenience is shifting fandom into an obsessive lifestyle. Due to the availability of online streaming, watching a game is always at your fingertips. Games that used to be considered national, must-see events — events where you cleared your calendar to make sure you were in front of a TV — are now just small moments in a sports fan’s life that revolves around everything sports. Fantasy Sports: Fantasy sports have been around for a relatively long time, and for the most part, participating in a fantasy league is a fun, occasionally competitive way to socialize with friends, co-workers, etc. However, it has completely shifted the way that fans view and interact with sports. As fans, we are extremely loyal individuals. Or, we used to be at the very least. Fantasy sports has shifted fans attention from teams to individual players, a shift that enables fans to spend even more time engaging with sports content. “64% of fantasy players say they are watching more live sports while 61% say they are reading more about sports because of their involvement in fantasy.” Due to the increase in familiarity with players on different teams and in different leagues, fans are spending more and more time viewing additional games, that previously, they would have never watched. Week in and week out, fantasy sports participants are checking in on “their” players to see how they’re performing. While there is nothing wrong with this, the consistent, year-round monitoring and checking is the kind of behavior that is transforming sports in an obsessive lifestyle. Quiet Sunday afternoons filled with fans contently and quietly watching their favorite teams have been replaced by channel flipping angst, social media refreshing, and lineup monitoring by fantasy participants checking if the Ravens Defense has given up a field goal — often leading to a viewing experience that is overly active, disruptive, and potentially exhausting. “73% of fantasy sports participants have purchased memorabilia related to their fantasy teams.” The world of fantasy sports has turned into a business, constantly producing mock drafts and daily fantasy challenges that allows for fans to remain engaged 365 days-a-year. Not only does this allow fans to interact with sports once the actual season ends, it actually encourages them to immerse themselves in the content. The availability of this year-round content via technology, specifically the internet and social media, has heavily contributed to the alteration in fan experience. Sports Gambling: This is where things could get interesting — and dangerous. For years, sports gambling has been illegal in the United States outside of Las Vegas, NV. There was no legal betting on players, teams, outcomes, etc. Until now. In 2018, the Supreme Court overturned the federal statute that prohibited sports gambling. Following this ruling, states quickly began to express interest in legalizing sports gambling within their territory. And with good reason. The impact that sports betting could have on revenue is profound, with PricewaterhouseCoopers estimating, “a fully developed sports gambling industry in all 50 states would bring in $100 billion in bets each year.” However, while this number is staggering, the potential impact that this will have on continuing the transformation of sports fans lives is also noteworthy. The integration of legalized sports gambling into sports via technology, such as digitalized gambling platforms and websites, will dramatically increase the in-game activity rate of sports fans across the country. While there are prop bets, the current sports gambling experience is centrally focused on bets tied to the outcome of a game. However, in the future, individuals will be able to bet on every aspect of every game; turning an event that can often be monotonous, and occasionally dull, into a fully interactive experience. Imagine a situation in which the Philadelphia Eagles are beating the New York Giants by 28 points going into the fourth quarter on a Sunday afternoon. In most situations, fans would turn off the game and try to be productive for the remainder of their weekend. However, if a fan could place real-time bets on how many 1st downs the Eagles will have the remainder of the game or the number of sacks on Eli Manning in the final few minutes, the decision to continue watching would be far more appealing. “Where I’m fascinated is what that does to fan consumption behaviors — the reason people are watching and what that does long term to their affinity as a fan.” Due to this increase in appeal, sports fans will continue to interact and engage with games even as they become uninteresting blow-outs. Ultimately, this just means more hours spent watching, engaging, and interacting with sports. The availability of sports betting in the near future will be another medium for fans to constantly monitor and engage with, continuing the trend towards a more active fan experience, and ultimately, furthering the solidification of a sports driven lifestyle via technology. Virtual Reality: In recent years, stadiums and arenas across the country have spent millions of dollars improving their amenities in order to draw fans out of their homes and into the stands. However, advances in virtual reality technology, along with a dropping price point, may halt this progress. While the technology has not yet become a staple in the sports fans viewing experience, virtual reality represents the next step in the evolution of viewing sports. With a virtual reality headset, one can watch from the field without ever leaving their living room. In most situations, a VR headset and an app is all that is needed to allow an individual to partake in the experience. The virtual reality experience is designed to be upgraded and improved as more technologies become compatible with the device — an event that will certainly happen as major technology companies turn their attention towards the growing VR market. Currently, VR lacks diversity and depth in its viewing options, but due to the intrigue and demand from customers, CEO’s of company’s that specialize in the field are confident in its capabilities. “This is the most realistic experience you get from viewing a sporting event without actually attending in person.” As the virtual reality experience develops and the technology supporting the device continues to advance, fans will be treated to customized game-day experience that will include up to the second statistics, tours around the stadium and locker rooms, and virtual suites where they can interact with other “attendees”. By using and engaging with virtual reality, fans have fully departed from the passive viewing experience that characterized watching sports from their homes in the 1970s and 80s. Virtual reality represents the full integration of technology into sports, providing a fully immersive and active viewing experience for fans. From fantasy sports updates to up-to-the-minute data analytics, virtual reality provides an all-in-one platform that enables the obsessive nature of today’s sports fans. Ultimately, this creates fans that are reliant on technology to view sports and forces traditional viewing methods to fall out of favor. The life of a fan has changed. That is obvious. And it will continue to change as technology advances and fans incessant urge to interact with sports content increases. Today, fans lives are dictated by the availability of sports content. I know this because I am one. Year round there is an unprecedented amount of information, articles, videos, leagues, games, you name it, to interact with and consume. Checking, monitoring, watching, and refreshing has become the standard. But while this all may seem excessive, and at some points it is, were fans better off just passively watching “the game” at home, through a low-definition television, without the constant activity of changing lineups or placing bets? “Please. It’s not even close. While the noise, hype and overreaction surrounding even the most trivial sports events can be infuriating, only an aging curmudgeon would make the case that the fan was better served in the ’80s than today.” Being a sports fan has never been better — or easier. The increase in technology has allowed for sports to evolve into a 24/7, 365 day-a-year fan experience, ultimately, turning a passive hobby into an enveloping lifestyle. While games and content has never been easier to access, as technology continues to develop, fans will, at some point, have to draw the line and regain control of their sports-driven lives. -- -- Best place to learn about AR& VR.

On taking a food technology GCSE in secondary school, I was quickly disappointed to find that there was very little cooking, and instead the course was focussed on creating ‘products’ that required packages, methodologies, and design briefs. A design brief functions as ‘instructions to a designer explaining what they should be designing for a particular project and any factors they should bear in mind’ (Collin, 2006). The Stack: On Software and Sovereignty, according to the author Benjamin Bratton should be read as a design brief. In the preface the intention of the book is simply given through the statement that ‘this book is a design brief’. (Bratton, 2015: xix) This design brief comes with many keywords and neologism, that are explained in the glossary at the end of the book, a move that is reminiscent of Keywords by Raymond Williams. However, rather than articulating a contemporary academic/social/cultural zeitgeist that William’s does, Bratton articulates a future zeitgeist. ‘Oceanic data centres’, ‘loop topology’ and ‘earth layer’, wouldn’t sound out of place in a William Gibson novel, indeed next to the many things that Bratton describes his book as — ‘political philosophy’, ‘architectural theory, and software studies’ — ‘science fiction’ is one of them (Bratton, 2015: xvii). I will add media theory to this list as the book is slowly becoming part of canonical digital media theory sitting alongside works by Keller Easterling’s Extrastatecraft and Luciana Parisi’s Contagious Architecture. The Stack aligns with these works in providing a materialist underpinning for the combatting ‘the historical emergence [of] planetary-scale computation and neoliberalism’. (Bratton, 2015: 21) Due to the status of The Stack and the fact that the book has been out for four years it has therefore had many notable reviews of the work. Those who have reviewed the book have vacillated in their appreciation of the work. Marc Tuters has called the book a ‘consequential contribution for the future of the new media theory’ (Tuters, 2016). Ian Bogost presents a curious review of The Stack, relaying an interaction he and Bratton had on a chance meeting after a symposium. Bogost said that after having a ‘stimulating’ discussion with Bratton the conversation became ‘a bit overwhelming. I’ll take the blame for that — I am not necessarily built for Bratton’s level and volume of scholarly intensity. He is the more serious intellectual.’ (Bogost, 2018: 389) Perhaps scathingly Bogost concludes that ‘The Stack still demands to be read or at least to be owned and thumbed through — a talisman for the further work it will doubtless inspire.’ (Bogost, 2018: 390) A talisman is an object that is believed to bring good luck and have magical properties. For example, a well-known symbol that functions as a talisman is the Ouroboros, a snake eating its own tail. It can refer to a process that is either circulatory or that is infinite, its more ancient meaning can refer to devouring oneself. Bratton states that the ‘stack to come’ may well be ‘powered by an Ouroboros-shaped energy grid that distributes electrons in peer-to-peer packet networks’. (Bratton, 2015: 294) Far less preoccupied by The Stack’s occult connotations Roger Whitson is highly complementary of the book and states that Bratton refuses the ‘typical conservative response… to reify a Vitruvian corpse who is clearly no longer the measure of all things’ when faced with the ‘consequences of computation’ and states that book equips the reader with the tools of combatting the ensuing vertigo of dealing with the impending primacy of the ‘emerging mechanosphere’ (Whitson, 2016). The ‘emerging mechanosphere’, what Bratton calls, ‘planetary computation’ has led to the erosion of old forms matter and knowledge, Paul Virilio states in Lost Dimension this erosion is caused by the decentring of ‘the geocentric earth or the anthropocentric human. It is now the luminous point of a helio-centrism or, better yet, of a lumino-centrism’. (Virilio, 1991: 43) Virilio goes on to state that society is defined as ‘the metamorphoses of acceleration [that] contribute to the deformation of ancient reference points, such as physical standards and other architectural archetypes.’ (Virilio, 1991: 84) In The Stack Bratton states that society is in a similar moment but states that design offers a way out through offering a ‘structuring of the world in reaction to an accelerated decay and in projective anticipation of a condition that is now only the ghostliest of a virtual present tense.’ (Bratton, 2015: 354) Bratton differs from Virilio though suggesting that a solution exists not through binaries, Virilio gives this as the opposition between ‘reality and post-reality’ (Virilio, 1991: 84) but through an articulation of a fluid state of design that can become ‘a design for accommodating (or refusing to accommodate) the post-whatever-is-melting-into-air and prototyping for pre-what-comes-next: a strategic, groping navigation (however helpless) of the punctuations that bridge between these two.’ (Bratton, 2015: 354). Bratton can be seen to do away with simple binaries in dealing with the question of technological emergence and puts forward a methodology, in his design brief, that is intended to replicate the heterogeneity of his topic of ‘planetary computation’. This tactic has been passed over by review of The Stack by R. Joshua Scannell, who sees the book as politically ambivalent as it relies to heavily on ‘intellectual play’ that is used ‘as a way of escaping the ethical and political stakes that inhere in critique’. (Scannell, 2018) Mackenzie Wark, on the other hand, sees the book as a healthy dose of even-handed accelerationist thought that gives a space, if not a paradigm, for our posthuman possibilities. Wark sees the concept of the stack as ‘not one infrastructure, but a laminating of relatively autonomous layers’ (Wark, 2016) in which humans will invariably form only part of ‘the stack to come’ where our role may shift from ‘authors of the Anthropocene to the role of supporting actors in the arrival of the post-Anthropocene.’ (Bratton, 2015: 293, 365) Where humanity exists in this post-anthropocentric stack is summarised by Bratton at the end of the book which is also the conclusion an e-flux article by Bratton which is titled ‘The Black Stack’: ‘The Black Stack may also be black because we cannot see our own reflection in it. In the last instance, its accelerationist geopolitics is less eschatological than chemical, because its grounding of time is based less on the promise of historical dialectics than on the rot of isotope decay. It is drawn, I believe, by an inhuman and inhumanist molecular form-finding: pre-Cambrian flora changed into peat oil changed into children’s toys, dinosaurs changed into birds changed into ceremonial headdresses, computation itself converted into whatever metamachine comes next, and Stack into Black Stack.’ (Bratton, 2014 & 2015: 365) Here Bratton reveals the layers of his indebtedness to his accelerationist thinkers like Reza Negarestani, Ray Brassier, and, Nick Land, in dealing with the materially consumptive process of capital that can only be accelerated as opposed to attempting to arrest it, that is it can only be stopped through accelerating the process. Land states that writing necessarily comes out of this process and is directed to the process of acceleration, ‘initiated in an annihilation of the world, but one that is at first isolated. Such writing is a darkness that is itself germinated in the dark; emerging fungally in a blackness that normally extinguishes it.’ (Land, 1992: 186) Similarly Bratton sees the stack to come, that is the black stack, residing in ‘a black hole of data centre-shaped ruins’. (Bratton, 2015: 295) Both writers go to the limit of negation, Land, however, ends his monograph on Bataille in stating the impossibility of achieving pure negation: ‘death is not the word “death”, or any other word. The zero of words is not the word “zero”’. (Land, 1992: 210) Land’s pessimism comes from the unbridgeable gap between signifier and signified. Always concerned with the impossibility of negation Beckett, in this poem below, creates that idea that through getting closer to zero, one is getting hotter, the double meaning of ‘incalescent’, meaning getting hotter and ardour, also suggesting that it was a process that was source of his own ardour, that of finding zero: From y to z 95.1 percent From the dearest decimal dead Incalescent (Beckett, 2009: 60) Land, like Beckett, sees the impossibility to get beyond language, the impossibility ‘to find the zero of the words’, as the main task that their writing needed to address, that is the need to address the problem of the symbolic. Bratton on the other hand sees the problem as both symbolic and materialistic: ‘As the last starting point, design of the next Stack must not define itself by a symbolic or operational opposition between the virtual and the real, or the soft and the hard (or even the thinking and the unthinking). It must work with both the positive assembly of matter in the void, on the plane and in the world, and also with the negative manoeuvre of information as the world, from its form and through its air.’ (Bratton, 2015: 358). Bratton reframes the problem in a materialist guise, one that is concerned with ‘the positive assembly of matter’. Therefore, rather than exclusively drawing on the symbolic negativity of these accelerationist thinkers, Bratton marries the positivism of the computer science terminology of the stack in the negativity of the techno-nihilism of these promethean thinkers. His concept of the Black Stack aims at finding the limits of negation but with a view to being able to reconstruct this into a ‘positive assembly’ through his design brief. The book therefore is not the work of a ‘mad, black Deleuzian’, a term Brassier used to described Land as at the 2010 ‘Accelerationism’ symposium at Goldsmiths (Brassier, 2010), and instead functions as a ‘mad, black design brief’. I spent the next two years of my food technology GCSE trying my hardest to avoid designing food products and instead actually cooking. I did this with some success mainly by attending only the practical classes. I was eventually told to attend both theory and practical classes, and informed that I would be better at cooking if I designed the products. I ended up designing a ‘quiche’, but still to this day I can’t make a quiche. The material concerns of my design brief did not create a ‘positive assembly of matter’, my quiche was sludgy and still very fluid. I wonder if Bratton’s design brief will affect anything different, although undoubtedly the aim of the design brief in The Stack is to be very fluid avoiding simple oppositions of ‘the virtual and the real, or the soft and the hard (or even the thinking and the unthinking)’ and in so doing giving it the slippery form of being a ‘mad, black design brief’ for the future.

EMAIL PHISHING 2. FAKE GOOGLE ADS/SEO: An email arrives in your inbox, seemingly from a service you are familiar with or have used before. The email looks completely legitimate, but it is not. Hackers make their phishing emails look identical to legitimate service emails, with the same formats and design used, thus it can be difficult to differentiate them. In some cases, the company hackers are pretending to be from may not even have your email, but you might not even realize that. A quite known technique involving hackers replacing the top results in search engines with similar links to their websites. You use a search engine to look for crypto websites, click on the first results and end up on crooks’ sites because they have replaced legitimate results with their site URLs. 3. COPY PASTE: This method involves a program changing a wallet address you put in into one that belongs to crooks. You decide to transfer some kind of cryptocurrenty (whether it’s Bitcoin or Ethereum) to someone, copy their wallet address, paste it in your wallet and prepare to send the cryptocurrency. A special program, like CryptoShuffler, then changes the receiver’s wallet address into one of cyber crooks’ and you transfer the money to them without even realizing. 4. CLONE WEBSITES: A more elaborate technique involves crooks changing an URL when you type it in the browser address bar. You start typing the URL, it gets changed to a different one (a scam website), and you’re suddenly led to a different, but seemingly identical website. The site may look completely identical to the one you intended to access so you may not realize you’re dealing with a scam page until it is too late. 5. HACKED MOBILE APPS: If you are not careful when installing apps onto your smartphone, you should be especially wary of this method. Scammers can create apps that would supposedly allow you to participate in crypto-exchange, but after some time, you’d realize that you’re not trading anything with it, merely sending money to the scammer’s account. 6. WIFI HACKING A serious flaw in WPA, a security protocol for WiFi routers, can be taken advantage of to allow hackers to see data going through your WiFi network. Public WiFi (airport, cafe, station, etc.) users are particularly vulnerable to this. 7. SLACK HACKING BOTS: A bogus security warning relating to your wallet could be sent to you, you would unsuspectingly press on the URL in the warning, give away your private key and other wallet information, and suddenly someone would have access to your wallet. 8. BROWSER EXTENSIONS You need to be careful with browser extensions. There are many falsely offering to improve your experience when on trading websites, but instead of doing that, they could be recording everything you type in regards to your wallet. You need to be careful with such extensions, and before installing any of them, make sure they are safe to use. 9. MOBILE SMS 2FA It’s not unusual for services to rely on SMS 2FA (two-factor-authentication) for an extra layer of security for the users. However, hackers have found ways to intercept the SMS 2FA, gaining access to the code. This could grant them access to various accounts, including those of Coinbase. That’s all we have right now and Please note thes post only for education purposes so be careful from this bitcoin wallet hacks and please share this post thanks Originally published at http://top10bitcoinwallet.com on May 5, 2019. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*cq1Qv1qes5ypjAX9., https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*cq1Qv1qes5ypjAX9., https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*cq1Qv1qes5ypjAX9."

https://medium.com/comic-relief/load-testing-serverless-with-serverless-at-comic-relief-cb6b9fa026ee?source=tag_archive---------182-----------------------,Load testing Serverless with Serverless at Comic Relief,Published in Comic Relief Technology,Adam Clark,No Author URL,N/A,8 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Adam Clark Follow Comic Relief Technology -- Listen Share How we load test our Serverless applications (and legacy applications) using Serverless Artillery in the lead up to Red Nose Day 2019 Since its launch in 1988, Red Nose Day has become something of a British institution. It’s the day when people across the land can get together and raise money at home, school and work to support vulnerable people and communities in the UK and internationally. With a whole year of fairly pedestrian traffic and then five hours of everything being on the line, we need to be able to ensure that our systems fail and fall over gracefully. I am going to give you a run through of how we load test our systems continuously over and above peak load, ensuring that we aren’t introducing vulnerabilities that our applications won’t be able to handle during an onslaught of traffic. Give my previous article on the journey to serverless a read to get some context on how we got to getting nearly everything Serverless and massively reducing our AWS footprint. So, to understand where we are now with load testing, you need to know where we came from. We had previously used Siege deployed across a load of EC2 spot instances, all deployed using Terraform and Ansible. To simulate one of our most significant past traffic events, we had used 32 r4.large instances for a suite of slam tests. It allowed us to generate the required load to ensure our applications worked as expected. The downsides were quite immediately evident from an engineering (and cost) perspective. These were, Peter (Engineering Lead) and I struggled to understand the legacy approach and how we could move forward with it, we started googling for alternatives with immediate effect. We quickly came across two very suitable candidates; these were Goad and Serverless Artillery. We made a quick comparison of the two and settled on Serverless Artillery as it was written in NodeJS and used Serverless Framework, which was in line with the rest of our emerging Serverless applications. To give you a bit more context on our methodology, we generally perform a varying selection of tests against our applications, below is a quick explanation of each test type and why we do it, As far as our workflow for load tests, we store all of the load test plans alongside the artillery code for our tests in a single repository. We could probably keep the plans nearer to the applications that we are testing, but these things grow naturally, so, oh well! For every load test, we create a release in GitHub documenting the load test and any information or findings from it; we can then quickly go back to these at a later time, all code changes related to the load test are part of sed release. We report from Serverless Artillery to InfluxDB on the performance of the load test; we then visualise the report in Grafana and link to it in our GitHub releases. We run all our load tests from a separate AWS account to the application that we are testing, which gives us rapid insights into the cost of running the test and also means we don’t overrun our lambda invocation limits (it hopefully wouldn’t, we have very high invocation limits). We will also normally load test the application from a different AWS region to the one that the application is hosted in. It would probably be more scientific to run these from another cloud provider, to nearer replicate actual users, but it is near enough for us for the time being. So, to give you a full run through of how we load test our Gift Aid application with Serverless Artillery, I am going to need to provide you with some context. The best description of the application is a form that users submit their details so that we can claim gift aid on SMS donations. The traffic hitting the Gift Aid application is generally very spikey off the back of a call to action on a BBC broadcast channel, ramping up from 0 to 10’s of thousands of requests in a matter of seconds. It is probably our highest load application, but also one of our simplest user flows, as the bulk of the load is to a single lambda. In the following test, we define the endpoint for the Serverless backend, set a duration of 60 seconds, an arrival rate of 120 submissions per second ramping to 240 submissions per second. We then create our submission logic, that will submit a form with random data using the faker NPM module to the serverless endpoint. It’s that simple, I won’t go into to much more detail here, as both the Serverless Artillery and Artillery documentation are over and above what I can describe here. Once we have validated and run a lower traffic version of the test on our local machines to ensure that it works as expected, we run slsart deploy to deploy the load test to AWS and then invoke the load test using slasrt invoke. We will then immediately start to see counts of invoked load test lambdas in Grafana, seeing traffic start to hit the backend and can be on the lookout for errors or latency issues. On a ramp test, we will usually see the request ramp up and make sure that there aren’t any sudden dips in response rates or client errors. A common issue that we see on very sudden high spikes of traffic is that you will get a sizeable warm-up latency. Once the fleet of lambdas is provisioned and warm, this will generally come under control. We build our frontend applications to handle this initial spike and not freak out the user if it’s happening. A 382ms average on P99.99 is acceptable, but we do end up feeling sorry for the people watching a spinner for 8 seconds. For the night of TV, we generally get a progressively warm fleet of lambdas as the night progresses, so this is a bit of a non-issue. We can warm a fleet of lambdas when we know a spike is coming; the spikes generally aren’t that predictable though. When the load testing is running, we will be on high alert for errors from Sentry and IOPipe. We will generally try to fully replicate the alerts and dashboards for the load test environment to match production, to get us entirely used to what we would be looking at during campaign. In the lead up to campaign we also run several game days, where we bring stakeholders from across the business in on the testing & simulation. We run more extended versions of these tests to replicate a condensed version of the traffic profile for the night of TV while watching re-runs of Red Nose Day on youtube. This process helps to get the team used to what they will be looking at on the night and allows for communication routes to be created and optimised. The next step for us is to probably bring some degree of automation to our load tests and bring the tests into our Concourse CI pipelines alongside our feature tests. As new features come in it would be awesome to have an idea of the load implication on our systems and make sure that we aren’t bringing in any critical issues. That really is as simple as load testing is for us. We encourage every squad in the engineering team to do it and be comfortable with it. The process of load testing before Serverless always seemed like an uphill struggle, a bit of a pain and targeted at a niche skill set. Much like with everything in Serverless, it just takes away some of the extra rubbish hoops that you have to jump through to get peripheral stuff done and get on with your day. The price and time to load test are at such a negligible level now, it just doesn’t really factor in as a reason not to do it.

You’ve rehearsed your investor pitch, and you feel ready to go. Then you start pitching investors, but something isn’t right. The investor pitch is still not working. Investors are not biting. And the problem is you usually don’t get a second chance when you’re raising money. You’re usually are on your own to find and correct your mistakes. That’s why creating a great investor pitch isn’t easy. It takes time, and a lot of iterations, to get your pitch right. So, I thought it would helpful to focus on what not to do in an investor pitch. I’ve made many of these mistakes myself, and I’d really like to help you get your pitch right quicker.

The initial results appear to demonstrate that realistic meat products could be produced without the need to raise and slaughter animals. In the near future, based on successful studies, food technologist will be able to mass-produce meat directly from animal cells. Based on research conducted by CBInsights, alternative meat products represent potential big business. For this reason, major food giants from Tyson to Cargill are researching and investing in a future where most people will obtain their protein from sources other than traditional animal-based products. Lab-grown meat is different from plant-based products which are designed to look at taste like meat. An example of a plant-based product is a burger comes from Impossible Foods, a California-based company. This is a plant-based patty that bleeds and sizzles when it cooks.

Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so.​ ~Noam Chomsky Dear Friend, Happy New Year! Let’s hope this is the start of a good if not a great year. It seems that there is far too much bad news in the world today. As your Militant Optimist, I’m launching The GOOD NEWSletter to spread the good news, not news like “Kitten rescued in a tree” but news that makes you feel good because good people are doing good things to help society and the earth, not just one cat (sorry Kitty). Often, the news here will be related to advances in technology that will make your life or the lives of folks you may not know better now or in the near future. I will not touch on politics for obvious reasons. I’ve always been an early adopter of technology and am optimistic about the application of technology to improve our lives. I designed video technology to measure changes in pupil size for neuropharmacology research and sold it to the Canadian Department of Defense for research in early detection of nerve gas (constricted pupils). More recently I’ve dedicated myself to developing and promoting technologies to improve teaching and research, including pharmacologic calculation software. Now that everyone seems to be getting their daily outrage, aka “news,” from social media, I decided to help select and spread some good news for a change. With this newsletter, I will share technological advances from the numerous publications, newsletters, and interesting people I follow. One of my regular reads — the last print magazine I subscribe to — is Wired. My inspiration to be a Militant Optimist was the article entitled. It’s Time for Techies to Embrace Militant Optimism Again by Louis Rossetto (Wired 09.18.18). Louis reminds us that: Today individuals using new technologies are fomenting no fewer than five revolutions: I hope to relay several stories in each newsletter about how new technology and human effort will help us save the planet, and live longer healthier lives.

https://medium.com/@trevor_neilson/the-entrepreneurs-impact-summit-24723729c462?source=tag_archive---------66-----------------------,The Entrepreneurs Impact Summit,Written by Trevor Neilson,Trevor Neilson,No Author URL,N/A,3 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Trevor Neilson Follow -- Listen Share A Call for Entrepreneurs to Address the Biggest Problems We Face It’s impossible to read the business news without seeing the excitement around the pending IPO’s of companies like Lyft, Slack, Uber and Pinterest. One Forbes headline captured the fascination and frenzy by saying the IPO’s “could create a $230 billion windfall and 6,000 new millionaires.” The New York Times took it a step farther saying: “welcomed finally into the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area, the fleet of new millionaires are already itching to claim what has been promised all these years. They want cars. They want to open new restaurants. They want to throw bigger parties. And they want houses.” The question will be how many of them want to address the greatest threat humanity has ever faced — catastrophic climate change. The most important book on climate change in many years is The Uninhabitable Earth, and the author David Wallace-Wells’ first line summarizes the topic succinctly. “It is worse, much worse, than you think.” What follows is a terrifying wake up call, a comprehensive, scientifically validated view of where we headed. A few examples: · By the end of the century the coolest months in tropical South America, Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the warmest months at the end of the twentieth century. · The planet will need nearly twice as much food in 2050 as it does today and at the same time 75 billion tons of soil is lost each year. In the United States the rate of erosion is ten times as high as the natural replenishment rate; in China and India it is thirty to forty times as fast. · By 2100, if we do not halt carbon emissions, as much as 5 percent of the world’s population will be flooded every single year. · By the end of the century we will be seeing roughly 64 times as much land burning from wildfires every year as we saw in 2018 · We are currently making it all worse. Carbon emissions rose in the last year and we are now burning 80% more coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, than we were just in the year 2000. Peter Thiel’s famous quote, “(w)e wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters,” could easily be applied to the current disconnect between the focus of most entrepreneurs and the severity of the climate crisis we face. That’s why on June 13th — 14th we are convening the first Entrepreneurs Impact Summit in Santa Monica, CA. Entrepreneurs Impact Summit (EIS) will bring together approximately 300 innovative entrepreneurs, thought leaders and investors for the first event 100% focused on specific commitments by entrepreneurs to create a measurable, positive social impact. EIS will have several key components, including EIS will be structured around entrepreneurs making public and specific commitments to tackle challenges in areas like health, education, climate change, gender equality, clean energy and more. Future invitations will be based on demonstrated progress on these commitments, and each year an Entrepreneur Impact Award will recognize one participant whose commitment has shown measurable catalytic change. Over thirty companies have already signed on. “I applaud the Entrepreneurs Impact Summit for going beyond ‘raising awareness’ and ‘doing well by doing good.’ With Washington so broken, we need entrepreneurs to step forward and exercise the true power they have right now to spark and scale innovations that can confront the greatest challenges we face,” said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Let’s use the power of entrepreneurship not to only create wealth but to create change. At its best, entrepreneurship is about solving problems — about disrupting the trajectory of issues that seem intractable. Let’s not wait for government to solve the problems we face — let’s solve them ourselves. To learn more or register to attend click here.

https://medium.com/@sandeep4.verma/a-z-of-database-transactions-part-2-9d84ed7bb724?source=tag_archive---------33-----------------------,A-Z of Database Transactions (Part-2),Written by Sandeep Verma,Sandeep Verma,No Author URL,N/A,6 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Sandeep Verma Follow -- Listen Share Isolation level decides database’s behaviour during concurrent transactions In Part-1 on of this series, I have explained in detail the definitions of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability guarantees of A.C.I.D In Part-3 I have elucidated issues with concurrent writes and how databases handle those anomalies Read Uncommitted This is weakest level of isolation level. If two concurrent clients are reading/modifying the same data (A row in RDBMS or JSON document in Document databases), then the client is not blocked from a dirty read. In figure-1, ‘Client-1’ attempts to update the value of row with ‘user_id’ =123. He credits ₹ 10000 to his balance of ₹ 20000. But later his transaction was rolled back (Due to process crashed or some other constraint violation). ‘Client-2’ read this dirty value(A write which is not yet committed by ‘Client-1’) and reports ₹ 30000 balance in the user’s account. If he takes any other decision based on this dirty read later in the same transaction, he will make the user row to go in some inconsistent state. Though Read Uncommitted isolation level allows dirty reads, it provides the highest level of performance when compared to other isolation levels as the database doesn’t need to remember the last commit or maintain different versions of the commits of the same object(MVCC) Read Uncommitted prevents dirty writes (Figure-2) by taking a lock on the row which it is modifying. Any other transaction trying to modify the same row is forced to wait till this transaction either commits or rolled back. Read Commited This isolation level is better than “Read Uncommitted” as it also averts dirty reads. Read Committed isolation level render two guarantees : ‘Read Committed’ is the default isolation level in the following databases : These Databases prevent dirty reads by remembering old committed value corresponding to every object that is written. All ongoing transactions are given this old value until a new value is committed. Transaction switch to new value only when its made available by any of the ongoing transaction commits. Snapshot Isolation (Repeatable Read) ‘Read Committed’ isolation level can abort a transaction (deliver atomicity), arrests reading from an incomplete transaction(No dirty reads), halts concurrent data modification(No dirty writes), however, it doesn’t prevent a transaction from non-repeatable read or skew read. A non-repeatable read occurs, when during the course of a transaction, a row is retrieved twice and the values within the row differ between reads. In Figure-3, ‘client-1’ aims to move ₹ 10000 from ‘account-2’ to ‘account-1’. Just before fund movement, his total balance in each account was ₹ 20000. If he attempts to get check his balance such that one account reports just before fund movement and another report just after fund movement got completed, then he is bound to get an inconsistent view of his accounts (Account-1 reporting ₹ 20000 and account-2 reporting ₹ 10000). This aberration (Read skew) is accepted under “Read Committed” isolation level but is arrested by “Snapshot Isolation” Snapshot isolation is the solution to skew reads. Here each transaction gets a consistent snapshot of the database. This means each transaction sees all the data that was committed at the start of the transaction. If data changes while the transaction is under process (Commits in the same object by different transaction), undergoing transaction still reports the old committed snapshot(Committed object at the start of this transaction) Snapshot Isolation also takes write locks to prevents dirty writes, however, it doesn’t take read lock (Just like Read Committed). A key principle that snapshot isolation follows is: The reader never blocks writers and writers never block readers. This prevents lock contention between reading and writing. Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) Databases working at isolation level keeps several committed versions of an object side by side to prevent dirty reads. This methodology is known as MVCC, multi-version concurrency control. Several committed versions are required to ensure that each concurrent transaction gets a view to most recent commit. In Figure-4, let’s say the current version of an object is 3 (Version-3). If two concurrent transaction(Transaction-1 and Transaction-2) start reading this object, then both of them will get version-3 as an old snapshot. Now if one of the transaction commits (Transaction-2), then a version-4 of the object will be created. Ongoing transaction(Transaction-1) still sees version-3. If a new transaction starts now (Transaction-3), then it will take version 4 as an old snapshot. Later on, Garbage collection process cleans any version of the object that is not in use by any ongoing transaction. Serializable Serializable isolation guarantee is the strongest safety guarantee amongst all isolation level. Even if transactions are executing in parallel, the end result is the same as if they executed in serial order without any race conditions. This guarantees that transactions behave correctly whether they run individually or concurrently. Though this guarantee comes at the cost of performance which we will see in Part-3 of this series. Snapshot isolation doesn’t forbid phantom reads, which serializable does. Serialization acquires read and write locks on a range (On data returned by SELECT query) and release it when the transaction gets either committed or rolled back. Range-locks prevents phantom reads. Figure-5, shows a phantom read. Snapshot isolation prevents non-repeatable reads by taking a snapshot of the committed row. However, It cannot block other rows which take part in range queries. A phantom read occurs when, in the course of a transaction, two identical queries are executed, and the collection of rows returned by the second query is different from the first. Naming confusion of Snapshot Isolation/Repeatable Read/Seriazibility? Snapshot isolation is quite useful in read-only transactions. However, different databases that implement it, refer it by a different name. Oracle calls it Serializable, In PostgreSQL and MySQL refer it as Repeatable read. What’s really astonishing is that IBM DB2 refers ‘repeatable read’ as ‘Serializability’ The SQL standard doesn’t have the concept of snapshot isolation, instead, they define repeatable read, which looks superficially similar to snapshot isolation. PostgreSQL and MySQL call their snapshot isolation as repeatable read because it meets the requirement of being SQL standard compliant. In absence of a standard definition, even if a database vendor asserts ‘Repeatable Read’ guarantee, under the hood it can be very different from snapshot isolation. That’s all folks from Part-2 of this series. To know more about A.C.I.D safety guarantees, read Part-1. To upgrade your knowledge on write anomalies in a concurrent environment, read Part-3.

I felt like I didn’t belong here, that everyone else was way more qualified than me, and that it was going to become obvious very quickly that I couldn’t do it. All the insecurities I’d developed from four semesters of male-dominated classes were manifesting themselves in the worst way possible, and I couldn’t do anything about it. But then I got through my first day. I talked to other female interns and realized I wasn’t the only one who felt this way. I got through my first week. I talked to my manager, a woman, and felt inspired hearing about her long and successful career in tech. I got through my first month. Everyday, I became more comfortable with my role and my team, the new technologies and frameworks, and the software development process. But still — it’s hard to feel confident as a girl who didn’t start coding until college, in a world where it seems like most of the male software engineers have been coding since they were 10 years old. There was nothing encouraging me to pursue computer science when I was younger, to the extent that even though I was somewhat interested in the field, I never took a CS class in high school because it didn’t even occur to me that coding was something that girls did. I couldn’t even picture a female software engineer. In my mind, the word “programming” evoked images of men in hoodies furiously typing in front of giant computer screens while drinking cans of Red Bull. Of course, this all stemmed from a serious misconception on my part of what computer science actually was — but that misconception was informed by the reality that the vast majority of software engineers are men, and I think it’s a misconception that a lot of women tend to have. I’m so lucky that the company I’m interning at actively makes an effort towards inclusivity and equality, and that I’ve never felt like I’ve been treated any differently because of my gender here. My team is wonderful and always willing to help, and I really just genuinely love coming to work every day. As an intern, it feels great to be working on software that’s actually used by customers, and I’ve been able to talk to so many other women in the office in a variety of roles, and hear about their experiences. Salesforce is in the top 10 on Fortune’s list of best workplaces for women. Even before I applied to Salesforce, it was on my radar just because I’d heard so much about the company’s emphasis on equality and its dominance on lists like People’s “Companies that Care” and Glassdoor’s “Best Places to Work”. In the news, I’d read about Marc Benioff’s direct actions towards making sure his female employees were paid equally, and his constant strides towards gender equality within the company. 22% of the tech roles at Salesforce are held by women, which is a better-than-average reflection of the world of computer science: 18% of CS bachelor’s degrees are earned by women and around 16% of software engineers are female. But even though 22% is pretty good for tech, being outnumbered by men 4-to-1 can still be intimidating. The root of the problem is that not enough girls are encouraged to pursue computer science from a younger age. And that’s not a problem that’s easily solvable, especially when keeping women in tech is almost as difficult as getting them there to begin with. I’ve been extremely lucky with my experience. My confidence has improved dramatically as the summer has gone on. My internship at Salesforce has given me some of the best weeks of my life and I’ve learned so much, both on a technical level and about the software development process as a whole. I’m no longer terrified of speaking in meetings. I don’t try to avoid asking questions out of fear of sounding incompetent anymore. The inclusive and welcoming culture at Salesforce is something that I think every company should have, but one that I believe is especially valuable for women — it has been for me. Ultimately, going back to the original question, I don’t know if I’ll ever truly feel like I’m “good enough.” But interning at Salesforce has given me the confidence that at the very least, I belong in tech. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*3z-kq6XGNSNdPjhd.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*3z-kq6XGNSNdPjhd.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*3z-kq6XGNSNdPjhd.jpg"

It featured a time-traveling, bodybuilding robot that was sent from the future to protect a boy from a second time-traveling robot made of liquid metal. I think you know the movie I’m talking about. It was full of interesting ideas, but the liquid-metal robot in particular inspired Wenzhuo Wu, a Purdue University industrial engineering professor, to create his own liquid metal technology that could power wearables in the future. The technology is called LMI-TENG, which stands for “liquid-metal-inclusion based triboelectric nanogenerator.” That’s quite the mouthful, but it is essentially an advanced materials science fabrication method for sensing and harvesting biomechanical energy from the human body. In this application, that’s accomplished by creating a layered sandwich of materials. The outer layers are a flexible, but solid, material called Ecoflex. The inner layer is liquid metal embedded with functional silicone. The result is a flexible, form-fitting patch that can be worn on the skin and that generates small amounts of electricity from movement. That electricity can then be used to power ultra-efficient wearable devices, or even to control those devices. When worn over your finger, for example, the material would harvest energy when you extend or contract your finger. That can be measured, and used as a method for interacting with a wearable device, just like a button click. Wu’s team demonstrates that with an Arduino Uno, but the same technique could be used for a wide range of applications. -- -- Author, writer, maker, and a former mechanical designer. www.cameroncoward.com @cameron_coward Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dHDkUb1xLjTUc8ZNnT7_ig.jpeg"

Two dozen companies alone have proposed launching well over 20,000 satellites in the next 10 years. For context, fewer than 8,100 payloads have been placed in Earth’s orbit since the space… -- -- MIT Technology Review Reporting on important technologies and innovators since 1899 Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*fRTAqrjmS6BLG1L49aq-dg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*GSjyrn5Q7AIEg3T8eeKihg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*GSjyrn5Q7AIEg3T8eeKihg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*GSjyrn5Q7AIEg3T8eeKihg.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*fRTAqrjmS6BLG1L49aq-dg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*fRTAqrjmS6BLG1L49aq-dg.jpeg"

The algorithm, acquainted with your tastes, suggests ads about a topic you discussed with a friend two hours earlier. It’s a cold night, and as you get closer to your house, you tap the smart home app to turn on the heat before you arrive. You get home to find that your partner threw away a garment they bought two months ago. You can’t help but visualize all the waste accumulating in the world. Overwhelmed with dread, you head to the basement to check on your crypto mining setup. The room is hot from the exhaust, so you open the windows to let in some airflow. You’ve made considerable amounts of money in the crypto market. Time to plan a new trip, maybe Bali? But Bali is suffering from over-tourism. The guilt sets in once again. You open a meditation app to declutter your mind. The soft voice stemming from the device gently guides you, and, as the sound fades into the background, you slowly fall asleep. We are living in a time when our digital and physical experiences seamlessly blur into one. In the story above, we see how the character moves back and forth between the phone and the physical environment. Consequently, the actions they take in both spaces impact one another and consolidate into one unique experience. The story also depicts the implications these experiences have on our surroundings and, therefore, highlights the need to address them holistically. The social media platform, the meditation app, and so forth, represent individual worlds crafted, in part, by UX designers, to effortlessly flow into our daily lives by diminishing friction and championing human psychology. However, as the digital and the physical become further interconnected, the other worlds of the digital inevitably expand into our physical environments and further augment our universe into one multifaceted system. As we move into the future, UX designers will play a critical role in shaping the connection between the digital world and the physical environment while addressing the positive and negative side effects they may perpetuate. Some of the negative aspects are well known, such as technology’s impact on mental health and on the natural environment. However, other challenges exist at a more insidious level as questions of data, privacy, racial bias, AI, and security arise with our newfound interconnectedness. Tackling these challenges requires a holistic design approach that encompasses the macro impact of these new relationships. To do so, designers should adopt a systems-thinking methodology to help them identify, analyze, intervene, and maintain the stability of these systemic multiverses. “Smart” objects come to mind when discussing the interconnected relationship between the digital and the physical. While smart objects do play a crucial role in the development of this hybrid landscape, they are ultimately one small node in the network. From a business perspective, smart objects are a useful tool for companies looking to move beyond the limitations of competing for customers based solely on price point. With a trove of user data at their disposal, businesses can find new opportunities by leveraging the data gathered by smart objects to create stronger customer relationships. This scenario, while beneficial from a business standpoint, brings up questions about the ethics of leveraging customer data for financial gain. Besides, the security of the data itself is a big concern, primarily when its safety relies on not only the user’s discretion but also on the morality of the companies collecting it. As a systems-oriented UX designer, the above scenario presents an opportunity to improve a systemic problem by addressing how to protect user data while addressing business needs. The first step would be to understand the systems at play (business structure and user data distribution) to identify a vulnerable point in the framework that could be leveraged for improvement. Otherwise known as “leverage points,” these vulnerable points are “places within a complex system (a corporation, an economy, a living body, a city, an ecosystem) where a small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything.” (Places to Intervene in a System by Donella H. Meadows) The examples above fall into the category of a cybernetic system that operates through feedback loops towards achieving a specific goal. As the controller, finding the leverage point can allow you to adjust the system to better perform its intended task. To find the leverage point in the above scenario, the designer has to first understand the role data plays in the relationship between the user and the company while accounting for the user’s approach to data security in their daily lives. Essentially, they need to identify the system type, how it behaves, and the information within it before they can effectively intervene. Once the leverage point is detected, the designer can move forward to intervene in the system’s behavior. Donella Meadows further explores nine potential leverage points in this article. “People know intuitively where leverage points are. Time after time I’ve done an analysis of a company, and I’ve figured out a leverage point. Then I’ve gone to thecompany and discovered that everyone is pushing it in the wrong direction!” — Jay Forrester Framing these systems as unique worlds in and of themselves can help us assimilate the complexity required to design for them. It can also allow us to understand the psychological impact they have on our daily lives. If we were to frame Facebook as a system creating a unique digital world, we could better pinpoint the anomalies causing mental health distress and sociopolitical conflict. Once identified, we could design frameworks that help us intervene in the very aspects of the system that perpetuate these unintended side effects instead of relying on new features and modifications to solve the problem. Moreover, how we communicate these challenges is critical to involving stakeholders in the effort to improve them. However, this can only be achieved if we have a solid understanding of how these systems behave inter-relationally. At their core, all of these multiverses are shaped by a unique paradigm, a value proposition, a set of beliefs that fuels them and entices others to engage with them. Whether it is a large corporation, a small startup, or a country, the paradigm is so embedded in its cultural identity that it becomes challenging to leverage change within it. The more accustomed users and stakeholders become to the success, the brand, or the experience of a product, the less likely they are to want to change it. The best way to engage others in a discussion of paradigm change is by modeling the system. Conceptual maps are a great tool to diagram a system and identify its information, behaviors, relationships, and determine leverage points. Additionally, when it comes to getting stakeholders on board, the concept map plays a crucial role in communicating its anomalies visually. Envision the diagrams as maps of these unique worlds that depict their affinities, their connections, and the frameworks supporting them. Today, the need to propose new paradigms is imperative as we confront some of the most promising and challenging events facing humanity. Undoubtedly, designing and intervening at a systemic level is complicated, time-sensitive, and potentially overwhelming. However, as designers, we have the analytical and creative skills to not only identify faulty frameworks but to reimagine and propose new ways of transitioning into entirely new modes of thinking. Systems thinking allows us to frame design solutions that tackle the root of a problem instead of acting as a temporary band-aid bound to come undone. While the interconnectedness enabled by technological adoption has pushed the world towards a homogenous future, the vast majority of the globe remains a collection of smaller universes with their unique systems supporting them. Technology, with its ability to augment the way we experience these worlds, has, in turn, created an even more complex tapestry of multiverses hybridizing the natural and the artificial. Whether it’s the old or new conventions, existing paradigms are bound to break as we contend with this new future. As designers, it behooves us to sharpen and expand our skills, so we can contribute ideas and approaches that shape the paradigms of the future.

Today a perfectly normal thing to be talking about, but 20 years ago nobody would have known what it was, or what it would become. It has overrun society. If you don't know what it is... I don't even know what to say to you. You don't have to be involved in it,but it takes some serious searching to find somebody that doesn't know what social media is. There are arguments about why it is good for society, and why it is bad. Today, I'm looking at the arguments for it, and arguments against it. At the end I explain whether or not I think social media is ultimately a good thing for society or not. - Social media helps us connect with friends we don't see too often I agree. Social media has the power to connect friends that are worlds away, but is that really what it is used for typically? No, most kids use it to talk to people that they encounter on a regular basis. So, while I agree with the premise of the argument, I have to say that I don't think that is what the majority of people use it for. Not saying there are no people that use it for this purpose, simply the majority of users. - It allows you to get new ideas from people/places you never would have had the opportunity to get ideas from I agree 100%. This is one of the things that I love about social media. I think it can increase your creativity, and simply expose you to new things that you might never have known interest you. One of the best things, and most supportive arguments for social media. - It allows for the spreading of a message This one is tricky. I can't deny that it gives you the ability to spread a message, but I don't know if this is a good thing or not. Obviously it can be good or bad, I just don't know which one ends up winning more often than not. The problem is that ANY message can be spread. On the one hand, you have a start-up company that benefits hugely from an online presence that allows them to be found, and get off the ground. On the other hand, you have a terrorist why has the ability, at the click of a button, strike fear into the hearts of millions of people. But, I agree that this can be a good thing for society. - It is a waste of time, and encourages people to waste time endlessly Depends. Now, I think the majority of people use social media abusively, not at all in the way that it was originally intended. When asked about Facebook's negative effects on people, Zuckerberg was quoted saying ""consuming content instead of a platform for friends quote."" And that is exactly what has happened. People have stopped using the platform for how it was originally intended, and have started to use it as a place to go and mindlessly scroll through their feed liking stuff they won't even remember later that day. Shane you look at all of that, it's hard.to say that, as a whole, society doesn't use it as a means to waste time, and escape into surrealism. - It destroys relationships Sad but true. I think it is pathetic that we, as a society, have gotten to the point where we value a friendship on Facebook as real, and value a real friendship less if it's not online. I mean, think about that for a second. Who is your real friend, the person you met this afternoon on the subway and did a follow for follow, or the person who has known you for years but isn't following you on Facebook? - It is bad for people emotionally and mentally Also a little sad, but believable. This makes perfect sense for those people that already struggle with self-esteem, depression, and confidence. They go online to see what their friends did this weekend, and they see that everybody spent an amazing weekend watching the sunset and chillin with buddies on the beach They are flung into a self-pitying depression thinking about how lonely and unloved they are, and the cycle repeats itself. (Another issue is the fact that social media allows you to portray something that you are not. Everybody's weekend can look amazing in a picture and description.) There have been statistics proving that people who spend more time on social media experience higher rates of depression, and this cannot be laughed at. There are enough problems in the world, we don't need to be depressed about things that have nothing to do with us. I think that social media can be a great things for individuals, businesses, and responsible, intelligent people who have the self-respect and !maturity not to waste their time on it. However, when it comes to society as.a whole, I have to say that I think it is ultimately a bad thing. There are unfortunately enough stupid people in the world, and while social media is not to blame for them, it certainly gives them an unnecessary outlet for the world to view their stupidity so easily. It can (on a less extreme level) simply be a waste of time. Is it really worth it to spend 1-3 hours/day just mindlessly scrolling through things you don't really care about? For individuals, I think it can be great. A great way to share ideas, get new ideas, and even collaborate with other creatives from around the world. For businesses, I think it is empowering. It gives then the ability to reach new people, customers, or loyal followers that they might not have ever been able to otherwise reach. For responsible, intelligent people, I think it's great. It provides you the opportunity to connect with people you don't see as often as you'd like and maintain friendships. I For society as a whole, I think it is a terrible mistake. Communicating with more people, getting more friends, not bad things. This was the idea that social media was founded on. Friends... multiplied, and easier. Not a bad thing as an ideal, but ideals are always fine, it's what the ideal becomes that matters.

People tend to care about things such as What job do you have, what position are you, how much do you make? Answering these questions a certain way will instantly create an image about you. That image is a part of where you rank within society. No although this may not always be far, that is a topic for another day. But there is no denying that this does take place within society. But at the rate its moving, technology may all but eliminate the value work has with our society. I believe everyone has at least heard someone mention robots in the workplace or have has had a personal experience with robots. Whether that be by watching videos on the internet on how Amazon’s shipping facilities have an extremely advanced robotic sorting system. We’ve all seen the automated machines at local fast food chains that take your order instead of a person or have called customer services expecting to talk to a “real person” only to be greeted by a automated system. People do not go out shopping at stores as much as they once did. People can literally but anything they want online. Brick and mortar companies quickly becoming obsolete meaning all the jobs that are typically offered aren’t anymore. Dean D’Accolti, a classmate of mine has a blog about this very topic. In his blog D’Accolti says “ That’s 400–800 million people who could we displaced by automation in the next 12 years!”. Just to put that in perspective, with those figures the best case scenario is losing 33 million jobs every year for the next twelve years. That would put the unemployment rate at roughly 21%, its highest since the great depression. Twelve years is a blink of an eye. This is a rapidly growing issue that needs to be addressed. I believe D’Accolti said it best, “ The growth of technology is something that has been transparent for years and their is no doubt in anybody’s mind that jobs will be lost.” Credit: https://medium.com/machinery-got-the-job/robots-are-taking-our-jobs-53fb2b6c2514 -- -- What is the effect that technology has on Human Culture Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*f3AOI7XUfM6g9zpi.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:48:48/1*fF_jNX3sSydjRYnVUOYPlQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*fF_jNX3sSydjRYnVUOYPlQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*fF_jNX3sSydjRYnVUOYPlQ.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*f3AOI7XUfM6g9zpi.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*f3AOI7XUfM6g9zpi.jpg"

Relational databases often seek to mimic real life relations in order to better help us understand the data we work with. The structure of a relational database allows you to link information from different tables through the use of foreign keys (or indexes), which are used to uniquely identify any atomic piece of data within that table. Other tables may refer to that foreign key, so as to create a link between their data pieces and the piece pointed to by the foreign key. — Jacqueline Homan If you happen to be far more visual, like myself, here is an example of a schema for a relational database: The schema above shows the relationships between customers and items they have purchased. Each purchase represents and item an individual customer would own. Given the focus of this article is truly meant to be SQL, I will not delve in any more depth into relational databases. But please feel free to explore the topic more yourself. SQL queries are written to be able to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) actions with your database tables. This queries can become much more complex as the relationships of your tables increase in complexity. As with any computer language, the best way to truly learn it is with practice. So I will show a number of examples of how to use the CREATE TABLE, FROM, SELECT, WHERE, and AND/OR keywords with SQL. CREATE TABLE is as simple as it sounds. This command adds a new table to your database. More specifically, it allows you to name the table and to name each column within the table. If I were to use create table for the customers table in the schema pictured above it would look like this: Convention dictates that all SQL keywords are uppercased. You will also notice that each column is on a new line, this another best practice. While not necessary, both conventions make it far more readable to you and I. The FROM keyword is used to dictate which table you are accessing and the SELECT keyword is used to determine which columns you would like to see. If there were five customers in the table in our database, the above query is requesting all column information * from the customers table. And the result from that query would look like this: If instead, I just wanted the emails I would modify my SQL query to read: The return values would then be all five of the emails: The WHERE keyword indicates that you want to filter the results given a set of parameters. Only results where the condition you set evaluates to true will be returned. The above query selects all rows from the customers table where the id is greater than or equal to three. The return value for this query would look like: Thus far, we have only look at the more basic SQL queries. With more complex relationships, our SQL queries become far more complex. Those queries are not covered in this article on the basics. However, I want you to be aware of the many keywords that exist in SQL and I have listed them below. Please take a look, and if you have any interest in exploring any particular keyword in greater depth, feel free to research it further. A good place to start could be this List of SQL Commands.

For our audience, it would be interesting to hear how AR as a new marketing tool, could solve business problems and increase company profits? Interviewee: If you do not mind, I will begin at least with 3 spheres. In medicine and biology, AR is used as a training simulator of future doctors. Furthermore, AR devices helping patients to cope with a disease existing in psychiatry and psychotherapy. In real estate and architecture, AR is used to control the construction of buildings, bridges and other objects, and most often, for advertising and subsequent implementation of the object. During construction, AR allows visualizing the final result. Last but not least is the Retail sphere. “Try before you buy” option is definitely about AR. AR makes it possible for your consumer to explore and try on products presented in online store, catalog or simply items missing on a display case, and achieve the main goal of the store — to increase the number of loyal clients and boost sales. Interviewer: How about top-notch spheres such as electronics and robotics? Is it possible to include AR there? Interviewee: In this case, AR will facilitate the collaboration of high-level specialists and their less qualified colleagues on a remote advisory basis. An ordinary master, using augmented reality, will be able to receive instructions from an engineer to manufacture or repair a complex device. The use of AR is also possible in robotics. Thus, AR can be useful for robot path planning. Working with augmented reality, engineers will be able to develop routes with the help of robots will effectively explore those surfaces that are inaccessible to humans. These can be the surfaces of other planets, caves, ocean floors and other locations difficult or dangerous for a human to be.

Part I looked at the impacts of technical debt on enterprise employees. Part II decoded the different drivers behind debt accumulation, and how enterprises can approach debt analysis. In Part III, we explored the different solution models commonly adopted for debt resolution, with four product recommendations. Given that debt continues to be a pervasive yet often ignored challenge, it is vital for enterprises to find new ways to modernize that are sustainable and debt-lite. According to a 2019 research, 42% of executives, developers, and project managers aren’t even aware of their debt status — and only 10% are actively managing debt even as we speak. There are several ways enterprises can get on the right side of the debt conundrum, either taking incremental steps or adopting a holistic resolution roadmap. As I mentioned in the last blog, a holistic model is ideal given the fragmented nature of the debt, multiple enterprise verticals and silos, and the rapid pace of transformation we are witnessing today. By choosing an incremental approach, enterprises risk adding further debt to an already growing pile. In fact, an average developer in a typical enterprise spends 3.8 hours every week on resolving bad code, taking away from productivity. To begin with, a debt-ridden enterprise must take stock of the current IT infrastructure, highlighting the most crippling problem areas as well as better-performing parts. This includes a thorough assessment of the age, maturity, and design of your IT estate. Next, this should be followed up by a push towards modernized and future-ready infrastructure components. The objective of technical remediation should also include improving productivity and eliminating wasteful activities. The four prongs of undergoing a holistic shift towards a low-debt enterprise environment are: As discussed in Part II, cognitive has a role to play in both incremental and holistic debt resolution models. If you are choosing incremental, cognitive can help identify specific use cases, gaps in UX, and unalignment with the desired business functionality. More importantly, cognitive is the bedrock of any holistic transformation, intelligently assessing application priority and usage frequency. These applications are prime candidates for modernization. 2. Migrating to the cloud The public cloud eliminates the need to manage historical infrastructure, reducing both fiscal and code overheads. Enterprises can also increase the efficiency and velocity of transformation, without compromising on security requirements. Traditional manual tasks can be replaced via cloud-based automation, freeing up technical resources for genuine productivity. 3. Deploying digital workplace solutions Interestingly, the impact of technical debt extends far beyond technology. It slows down enterprise transformation, making employees less engaged and leading to lost opportunities for the business. “Technology laggard” organizations face a 6x higher attrition risk due to outdated technology when compared to digital-first enterprises. Therefore, it is so important to replace aging on-premise workplace tools with virtual, SaaS-based solutions. A digital workplace solution addresses multiple aspects of debt: ● It reduces capital expenditure by replacing expensive and fragmented software with a flexible, cloud-based and integration-ready system. ● Operational costs also shrink as new processes are easy to incorporate and employees can be quickly trained for new tasks. ● Productivity rises, benefiting the business bottom line — in a world where workplace IT issues creates a £4 billion productivity “black hole” in the UK alone, digital workplace solutions are a definite imperative. ● With rising employee engagement, productivity also improves, diverting manual tasks like bad code resolution to automated systems instead. 4. Developing an effective search strategy Another way to improve productivity is by optimizing and reducing technical debt in search & curation times of knowledge items. Employees are spending a disproportionate amount of time on search engines to confirm views, analyze competitors, and find missing information. Smarter enterprise search can help to quickly identify key pieces of data, making better decisions and enhancing overall enterprise capability. Microsoft Search and Omnity are among the top enterprise tools which can boost productivity and save time. Launched in 2016, Omnity is a research and semantic mapping search engine that helps to find related documents. You can discover how different knowledge items are interconnected, specifically in the fields of science, medicine, engineering, law, and finance. Enterprise search can also help marketers and knowledge workers to create unique content or identify innovative ideas. Importantly, Omnity comes in an enterprise version and as well an open/free option. Companies can integrate the tool with existing content management systems (CMS) and other repositories to create an enterprise-wide associative semantic search mechanism, essential creating an interconnected map between knowledge that is dispersed across documents. Technology giants across the world, recommend immediate workplace modernization as a key component of enterprise debt resolution strategies. For example, Intel applies Gartner’s TIME model for debt reduction where M or (or Migrate) refers to the indirect reduction of technical debt by consolidating to fewer platforms. The goal is simple: Identify frequently accessed apps and mission-critical workflows. Align these to a SaaS-based, 360-degree digital workplace counterpart. Migrate processes and eliminate end-of-life apps/systems to cut your losses. All enterprises need to do, therefore, is push back and take an objective look at their IT estate before taking the leap. -- -- Board Advisor, Strategy, Culture Alignment and Technology Advisor Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*1Pm4X-xPl60wuTYmwmLG2Q@2x.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*1Pm4X-xPl60wuTYmwmLG2Q@2x.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*1Pm4X-xPl60wuTYmwmLG2Q@2x.jpeg"

One of Charles Babbage’s (The Father of Computer) closest friends — Ada Lovelace, a brilliant Mathematician is the world’s first programmer. She translated Babbage’s paper on Analytical Engine ending up in her own notes written in a way the engine could be used for complex Mathematical number sequence. She was the one who introduced the concept of looping. She thought that it would become an interest of future generations. She died at the young age of 37 leaving a lasting impression on the course of computing. Tim Berners Lee and Vint Cerf are well — heard names in the world of internet.

The main difference this time around is Instagram is a much larger platform with 1 billion monthly active users compared to Pinterest’s 265 million. In the U.S. alone, Instagram went from a smaller platform than Pinterest in 2016 to one with 1.6 times the monthly active users by the middle of 2018. If Instagram gains the leverage to convince advertisers to settle for in-app purchases en masse it could spell the end for Pinterest. Source: Instagram The holy grail of visual search is to create a seamless experience for the customer to go from discovery to purchase. All of the big players are trying to provide the easiest path from visual search to purchase, but none have got it right so far. Pinterest’s first attempt to improve the shopping experience came in the form of buyable pins, which launched in 2015. Buyable pins allowed users to directly purchase the pinned item without leaving Pinterest. However, this feature was discontinued in the fall of 2018, showing that without a critical mass of advertisers and users it was impossible to convince enough retailers to give up the purchasing and behavior data they were losing by letting the purchase happen all on the Pinterest platform. The failure of buyable pins shows us that if Pinterest can’t grow into a much larger platform with negotiating power over advertisers it could fail to become a viable advertising platform. Even if you assume Pinterest is the second most profitable social platform behind Facebook and grows to be larger than both Snap and Twitter, the stock is still only worth $8/sh. For it to be worth the IPO price of $18/sh investors are betting Pinterest takes significant advertising dollars away from Facebook and Google, a feat no other social platform has accomplished in almost 10 years.

GFC is a unique project in Greece, India, UAE & the SE Balkans at this point in time, bringing a real revolution for these primary markets and establishing multiple direct export corridors for the organized farmers. No other e-auction networked with the production & consumption sites has been implemented in these regions. The auction platform’s capabilities are well-established and have already been tested in auctions operating in EU. The e-auction clocks reduce the producer’s lack of information on the sale price market and strengthens the market functions between buyers and sellers. Auctions reduce buyers’ power by letting them compete in a transparent market, reducing the asymmetric information and improving the efficiency of the sale’s process. In addition to the comparative advantages we have already mentioned, the structure and network we propose has no precedent, a decentralized National & International network of markets/ suppliers and standardization-warehouses all interconnected on the “Kosmos Aucxis” platform, and a central administration structure / (who generally provides all the necessary services) Based on this design, · No competition in the region, no similar project has been implemented yet · The distances are eliminated; 1clock per market / region, producer brings their productions to the aggregated depot / packing station near the producing sites. · The platform is not aware of restrictions or boundaries on participants, sellers, buyers, products… · Pan-Hellenic, Balkan, India and Middle-East International-wide project · A recurrent model , customer will return · Lower cost of functionality, due to the use of digital technology and de-centralization of operating costs · Low cost of participation for both sellers & buyers due to the use of digital technology · Direct liquidity and control in price negotiation (daily / weekly settlement in the collectivities / supplier’s account) · Direct access to markets and symmetric information · Real-Time selling values on auction clocks and negotiating power (Price fixing mechanism based on actual demand.

All members of the network use only “1 tool” to do all of their business and to exchange the necessary information, Kosmos aucxis new cloud base multi trade platform. Growers are becoming more and more demanding. Growers who do not feel comfortable do not extend their membership and would then operate independently, directly with the buyer, which can destroy the market in the long term. The auction market brings stable & fair average prices, which is important for the whole market. What GFC wants to create on as a fruit and vegetable sales organization? With respect to our suppliers: • Good product planning based on big data analysis, historical purchase data. Sufficient steady flow of products for the buyers, but not too much or too little. • Providing transparent information (reports of the sales results of the products supplied, average prices of the products sold, etc.). By merging data in the right way, we deliver added value for the F&V farmer. • Good support -> how do you provide this as to the grower, how can you produce more with a better quality? • Offer adequate services through our certified packing stations/partners(sorting, storage, repackaging…) • Collaboration: By working together, we gain marketing, commercial and negotiating power. We build a win-win situation for all stakeholders in the market. • Communication about the market’s needs, new tendencies • Targeted marketing campaigns With respect to the professional buyers, supermarkets, SP import/export companies, processing companies, chain of hotels, chain of restaurants, grocery chains, street markets, wholesalers, big shop owners: • Wide range of products — one stop shop.

Rarely do you get the opportunity to have such a large number of influential individuals and companies gathered together in one place. Representing Peltarion, I had the opportunity to attend this year’s Web Summit in Lisbon together with the team at Business Sweden / Sweden Co-Lab — a cross-sectoral innovation and collaboration platform. Below, some thoughts from me from these high-paced and inspiring days. I find myself sitting in one of the chill-out areas at Web Summit 2019, reflecting on my experience so far. The first thing that comes to mind is, this has got to be one of the best conferences I’ve ever attended. The summit, taking place between the 4th-7th of November in the beautiful city of Lisbon, Portugal, is the biggest tech event in Europe, bringing together over 70,000 attendees from 170 countries. Web Summit gathers founders and CEOs of some of the most renowned technology companies, fast-growing startups, policymakers and heads of state to ask one simple question: Where to next? As expected, many of the well-established tech giants are present, talking about all the incredible work they have and are planning to do. And there is nothing wrong with that. However, I’m more interested in hearing from the many buzzing startups, and in the last few days, I’ve spoken to many of all sizes. Web Summit has these categorized into three groups: Alpha, Beta and Growth. Having worked for companies both small and large, I appreciate the grind of trying to convince someone that what you’ve got could be the next big thing. I’m here for a couple of reasons; in fact, the obvious first one is to spread the word about the work we are doing at Peltarion in operationalizing AI. The second is to get insight into the challenges companies face when pushing the limits of AI, specifically deep learning. I’m curious to hear about what the pain points are when building and deploying deep learning models into production. This is what I found out: Not exactly. Productivity improvements will come when you free up both the data scientist and teams to focus on high-value activities, like modeling. The overall message I’m trying to get across is, it is paramount to effectively utilize the time of the data science team where it matters most. Without a doubt, there are a range of platform/product offerings that could help positively impact productivity. For example, working with prepared datasets (nirvana) and an intuitive graphical interface for developing and quickly iterating models, training them, evaluating and comparing results would have a huge impact. Businesses looking to the future know that artificial intelligence will become central to achieving a competitive edge. While there are many barriers to achieving success, AI can be accessible to all. We are by no means the perfect platform with all the answers, but we are continually evolving. Curious to see how we’re doing this? Try out our community edition and let us know what you think.

https://medium.com/@EventBank/event-spaces-as-a-service-event-venues-going-digital-c83fc64cd288?source=tag_archive---------131-----------------------,Event Spaces as a Service: Event Venues Going Digital,Event Spaces,Glue Up,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Glue Up Follow -- Listen Share Event Spaces are no longer about square footage, or dividers, tables, and chairs. Event Spaces are going digital, and that means you need to take advantage of this for your own benefit. Businesses like yours are moving digital, you’re likely using a CRM, email software, and a bunch of social media to generate buzz. If you’re looking to run a physical event, in person, and at a very real location, it’s hard to imagine digital being much more than sharing the event photos and takeaways after the fact. But you’re wrong. It’s the spaces themselves that are going digital, and you’ll want to listen in to how you take advantage of these shifting tides in physical event space real-estate. Co-working spaces have taken the world by storm, with brands like WeWork, previously NakedHub, Garage Society, and others taking the opportunity to house small businesses, startups, remote workers, and freelancers in cheap, just-enough spaces that offer communal amenities and a good working environment with a certain amount of business support. However, as long term property purchases come, rent always seeks to go higher, and what was initially a cost-effective way to run a business, has now become a cost as rent consistently rises until small teams can no longer afford the spaces. New property purchases and expansion help with costs, but the inflation rate and rising property costs always follow in its wake. Co-working spaces already have the business support and infrastructure in place, so the move to Event Spaces made more sense as businesses of any size can justify the cost of one-time events. Meaning it’s more likely to make revenue off space for events rather than tirelessly looking for tenants. Many tenants cannot scale as quickly as the rent does. Spaces like Garage Society started off as co-working, but have quickly moved into a sub-brand of their own for event space only, called Garage Commons, which is a series of new properties that are only for digitized event space hosting. While one location may host the physical event, the event can be live-streamed and projected to the other venues around the world to another physical audience inside those venues. And of course, if you’re planning to have a free event, then you just simply need to publicly live stream the event for all to see. Recently it’s becoming a trend for co-working spaces to venture into event space sales. It’s sort of a natural evolution for spaces that can’t rent smaller rooms for months or even years-long contracts with small businesses, freelancers, and startups that have difficulty staying afloat as-is. When it comes to events, however, any level of business finds use in event spaces both large and small, like corporate who can host something like a conference to as small as a round table luncheon. Events are also easy to expense as one-time expenses and even easier to justify the cost of the ticket price or level of engagement is juicy enough. In this light, co-working spaces and their parent organizations have been carting together, or privately expanding their event spaces to different cities. And sure, it’s nice to be in other cities. But the real value of having event spaces across different cities and countries is the leveraging of live streaming to expand your physical audience into the digital space. Event spaces have been transforming and reorganizing themselves to fit this model by either privately expanding as a chain with outright property purchases, like Garage Society in Hong Kong who’s been slowly but surely expanding its spaces across Asia. Others have taken the franchising route, meanwhile, other smaller event spaces without the means to expand have grouped together into a network of spaces that share a digital space, exchanging contacts and users among themselves. All of these formulas work in the same fashion, they’re using limited space to expand into an unlimited one, where your reach is exposed at your whim. Live Streaming has also taken more packaged forms provided by event spaces. Originally if you wanted to host an event, spaces would be bare-bones, and you’d have to bring your own equipment to the space in order to create a live stream. You’d also need a place to host it like YouTube, or your own live streaming web pages. These days, however, event spaces, and especially those that spawned from Co-working roots, have enough business support services and equipment to stream, record, and host high-quality, real-time live-streamed events for the web. As events become more exclusive, event organizers run into the issue of letting events live stream public, while still wanting to expand their audience to other geographies at once. Event spaces and their multitude of locations act as the perfect Remote Event venues. Each event space is connected to one another through their own private networks, which now gives events happening physically in one area the ability to project itself into other cities that have the same audience but still only for paying customers. Probably the sweetest deal ever made with venues in this vein of going digital is the partnerships. Before, an event ends, and the venue is left behind in the dust. You just move on and the venue aspect is in the rear-view mirror for your organization. Right? Do not make this mistake. Venues have other events at their location hundreds of times a year. Why not tap into the vast database of contacts, experience, and know-how? Event Spaces as well want their own ROI, just as much as you do. So approach the venue with an awesome partnership proposal. Maybe make your events exclusive to their locations? Sharing contacts is beneficial as well! This not only gives you an exchange of contacts and so on, but wouldn’t it make your event planning process a lot more painless if you know you have a venue that’s always there to support you, maybe even with preferred or even free pricing? Forget the digital aspect, but that venue partnership creates a long-lasting support beam for your future events, so why not take advantage of it? In this case, let the digital aspect be the icing n the cake. How do you take advantage of digital spaces? Easy. Just make sure you’re just as digital as they are.

Chatbot Conference 2019 in NYC Picking up from where we left off in the previous part of this blog, we’ll discuss 3 more key areas in which chatbots require diligent training. These features are inbuilt in Engati. Chatbots don’t come into existence on their own. We have to create, train, and maintain them throughout, on the basis of sets of data. These sets of data will widely vary from business to business, such as healthcare, banking, automobile, education, travel, hospitality, etc. However, training is imminent and therefore, we can build different types of chatbots to deal with data in different ways. These will, of course, be industry specific. We can build a scripted bot but that can only offer a limited set of functions or questions. In fact, it will only accept a narrow range of responses. Hence, the process will not be very efficient. So, you must make use of machine learning that will let you develop a bot with a growing set of knowledge and understanding. It will learn on its own by studying previous examples of chats. To mention a few cases: And remember, it’s easy to build a mediocre chatbot . All you have to do is just connect some APIs, write (or copy/paste) some lines of code, and that’s it. The difficulty and high effort begin when you implement a process for training the bot. Give it good data to feed on and train with, and it will work perfectly well. Creating FAQs manually is tedious and a waste of time. It’s a lot better to train the chatbot that will automatically identify and surface common questions from the conversation history. Further, it will recognise potential variations of those questions to make conversations seamless. Therefore, proper training of your chatbot would mean less work for your team on catering to individual customer queries and allowing them to focus on resolving more complex questions that require hands-on assistance. Therefore, with the FAQ builder feature on the Engati chatbot platform, you can upload an entire FAQ document and let the bot do the rest. It will identify questions and relate them with relevant answers to make your job simpler. Also, remember that training a bot isn’t a one-off task but an on-going process. Allow one of your team members to do a regular check to ensure that the customer-chatbot conversations are going as they should. The best aspect of the e.sense engine is that you require minimal setup data to get started with. Training the models is super easy and real-time. A lot of the aspects here can be customised according to the domain or the particular customer including custom synonyms, contextual handling, as well as intents and entity determination. Also, the core capability is available in multiple languages that makes it a very versatile offering. For more on chatbot technology, please visit Engati!

Real-time ray tracing will make hyper-realistic graphics on inexpensive hardware possible (and easier on developers). Meanwhile, cloud-based game streaming might finally go mainstream, removing the need for consoles altogether. Both offer compelling options to players and developers alike, but Sony is positioning itself to win no matter what. For the 2020 holiday season, Microsoft and Sony are preparing to launch their next generation platforms, as they do every few years. But things will be a little different this time around. With Google’s Stadia streaming gaming service launching next month, traditional console makers will face competition from a new and unlikely source. People will be able to stream new games like Doom Eternal without dedicated hardware — so why drop hundreds of dollars on a new PlayStation 5? High-end graphics may be the clearest reason. Both the upcoming Xbox (currently codenamed Project Scarlett) and the PS5 will support real-time ray tracing natively.

https://medium.com/@a.m.wilsonwideawake/on-fragility-and-hope-c2a285d59aab?source=tag_archive---------139-----------------------,On fragility and hope…,Written by A.M. Wilson,A.M. Wilson,No Author URL,N/A,4 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in A.M. Wilson Follow -- Listen Share Optimism arrives often with its best friend fear. You see, to want something is to worry about the opposite. For every cure, there’s a loss. For every acceptance letter, comes a rejection. For this reason, the Buddha asks us to refrain from optimism — faith in avoiding suffering often leads to suffering. The pragmatist warns us that optimism without work will not provide expected results. The Baghavad Gita (a growing favorite in terms of spirituality), suggests to let go of the outcome in our decisions, “You have the right to work, but for the work’s sake only. You have no right to the fruits of work.” On a personal, individual level, this all feels right, but, to me, it fails in one of the most important aspects of faith, which is to hold hope in others — in their best intentions. Certainly, there’s a fine line between hope and naivete, but it is, in my estimation, rational to be optimistic, while also letting go of the outcome. In fact, I think it’s the only sane way to live. Technologists and technophiles, the latter of which I sometimes find an uncomfortably accurate description of myself, point to the rising standard of living, the ability for humans to innovate out of past problems and the belief in human ingenuity as reasons to be long-term optimists. On this point, David Deutsch is especially an interesting thinker — he points out that humans have explanatory knowledge. This differs from biological knowledge, or our human genes, as we transfer explanatory knowledge to one another without needing to create new versions of ourselves. Richard Dawkins called such replicability in ideas as “memes,” a term that has been usurped by any number of cats. Explanatory knowledge can have errors and disruptions and malforms rapidly — a bad idea can be iterated on or forgotten about with no real cost. The same is not true for biological knowledge. And biological knowledge has limitations in scope. There’s no real need for biological knowledge to create a way to head to outer space (at least for the species we know of), for example, but explanatory knowledge has already managed to get humans to the moon. This speaks to optimism of a certain type — the belief that humans can and will overcome their problems by creating new tools and discovering new ways to describe our problems, of expanding our knowledge. As I understand Deutsch, he describes two fundamental parts to our world as humans — explanatory knowledge and the laws of physics. Instead of “explanatory knowledge,” I’d prefer to consider this same capacity as humans’ ability to tell stories. It seems to me, when put this way, that so much of human endeavor is focused on getting a story right or figuring out the story of something. Lawyers dispute the story of what happened, persuading a judge or jury based on their ethos, pathos, logos… Salespeople attempt to convince a potential customer their story is worth the customer’s money. Marketing departments create brands, which are largely stories about products… And on and on. This is important because the laws of physics are neutral to the concept of hope. Reality is indiscriminate — the same forces act on me as a bird when we jump out of a tree, but one of us is much better at flight. We as humans crave hope’s comfort. While happiness, friendship, joy, love, work, status, and life itself can appear so incredibly fragile, often because we do succumb to those immutable laws of physics, our stories make us resilient. Our stories give us optimism. Our stories inform who we are. Our stories give us hope. In this spirit, I want to conclude this post with the story of hope from the Greek myth of Pandora. Pandora, a curious and beautiful young girl, opened a box full of everything that would plague humankind: famine, sickness, passion and more. But at the bottom of the box there was one thing that removed the fear, at least temporarily: hope. Was hope a gift or a curse? I’d suggest it depends on what story you want to tell yourself about who you are. But I’d say hope for a better tomorrow has pushed many of us to invent something better than we know, open our eyes for another sunrise, welcome a stranger who becomes a lifelong friend, and so very much more. At times, it is hope, an amazingly small gift, that is all we have in a world that is so very, very fragile. -- -- Author of Populace; former journalist, farmer, librarian, burger flipper, bagboy, groundskeeper, political organizer, and shill.

(huhu) Hati-hati ya teman kalau kalian pernah mengalami hal itu. Sebab, penyakit di saluran pencernaan yang cukup serius seperti peradangan pada organ tertentu, bisa jadi memerlukan penanganan medis segera dan harus tepat sasaran. Ngomong-ngomong, tau gak sih ada banyak sekali prosedur medis yang digunakan untuk menangani kasus penyakit dalam? Yup, salah satunya adalah endoskopi! Wah, apa tuh? Mengenal Endoskopi Teruntuk kamu yang masih merasa asing dengan istilah endoskopi, ini dia penjelasannya. Jadi, endoskopi adalah istilah medis yang merujuk pada sebuah prosedur pemeriksaan untuk mendapatkan gambaran visual mengenai kondisi organ dalam pasien. Selain digunakan untuk pemeriksaan, endoskopi juga umum digunakan sebagai prosedur pembedahan. Alat yang digunakan untuk prosedur endoskopi ini disebut endoskop. Nah, tau nggak kalau endoskopi ini punya banyak nama lain? Istilah-istilah lain untuk menyebut endoskopi ini bergantung pada lokasi organ dalam yang diperiksa, salah satu contohnya adalah gastroskopi, yang akan menjadi fokus pada artikel ini. Gastroskopi atau yang sering disebut juga dengan esofagogastroduodenoskopi (hati-hati belibet bacanya) merupakan suatu prosedur pemeriksaan organ pada bagian perut, menggunakan endoskop yang dimasukkan lewat mulut. Haduh, serem ya kedengarannya? Tapi, prosedur ini sering digunakan untuk menginvestigasi pendarahan atau penyakit lain yang terletak pada daerah kerongkongan, perut, dan usus dua belas jari. Selain digunakan untuk pemeriksaan, gastroskopi juga umum digunakan untuk melakukan biopsi (pengambilan jaringan untuk dianalisis di luar tubuh). Meskipun gastroskopi diyakini mampu membantu pengobatan organ dalam perut, masih ada kekurangan yang dapat dibenahi. Salah satunya adalah masalah biaya. Dilansir dari salah satu rumah sakit di Amerika Serikat, pengobatan menggunakan metode gastroskopi dapat memakan biaya hingga sebesar 12,3 miliar dollar atau sekitar 173 triliun rupiah. Waaah angka yang sangat fantastis, bukan? Selain dari segi biaya, waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk melakukan gastroskopi juga masih terhitung lama. Pasalnya, pasien yang akan melakukan gastroskopi harus diberi obat bius. Pemberian obat bius ini disebut dengan anestesi. Pemeriksaan gastroskopi memakan waktu 15–30 menit ditambah 1–2 jam berdiam diri di rumah sakit guna menghabiskan obat bius. Hal ini tentunya dapat menghambat aktivitas sehari-hari pasien. Lalu, kekurangan yang terakhir adalah ketika gastroskopi digunakan sebagai prosedur biopsi, di mana biopsi gastroskopi ini hanya bisa mengambil sebagian kecil sampel jaringan tubuh untuk dianalisis. Hal ini kerap kali membuahkan hasil yang tidak akurat3. Tethered Capsule Endomicroscopy, Endoskopi yang Lebih Sederhana Berkat tetesan keringat dan kerja keras para insinyur kece, sekarang ini tengah dikembangkan sebuah terobosan baru untuk menggambarkan bagian organ dalam tubuh, khususnya bagian perut. Terobosan ini tidak perlu melalui prosedur anestesi. Yup, alat ini dinamakan TCE (Tethered Capsule Endomicroscopy). Pernah minum obat? Kan ada tuh yang sirup, kapsul, tablet. TCE ini mirip obat kapsul yang bisa ditelan, namun dihubungkan dengan tali tether yang fleksibel untuk mengontrol pergerakannya di dalam tubuh. Isi dari kapsulnya adalah perangkat-perangkat kecil dan mikroskop mini untuk pengamatan. Selain itu, TCE juga dilengkapi fitur yang dapat memberikan daya dan mengeluarkan cahaya saat mengirimkan gambar ke layar monitor. Makin penasaran dengan cara kerja TCE? Simak langkah-langkah berikut ini! Nah, alat ini telah diujicobakan kepada sejumlah relawan. Waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk menjalankan prosedur ini dari awal hingga akhir hanya berkisar 6 menit, termasuk di dalamnya 1 menit untuk proses pencitraan. Ternyata oh ternyata, mayoritas relawan lebih menyukai metode TCE daripada metode endoskopi konvensional! Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa TCE dapat menjadi alternatif untuk metode endoskopi yang lebih hemat, lebih singkat, dan lebih sederhana. Tetapi, teknologi TCE sekarang ini masih belum bisa digunakan untuk melakukan biopsi. Sampai saat ini, tindakan biopsi masih harus menggunakan endoskopi konvensional. Gimana menurut kalian mengenai terobosan yang satu ini? Keren banget kan? Sadar atau tidak sadar ternyata sudah sebegitu pesatnya, ya, kemajuan teknologi kesehatan saat ini. Setelah ini, pasti akan terus bermunculan alat-alat super canggih lainnya. Jangan-jangan, setelah ini alat super canggih akan datang dari Indonesia. Waw. Yuk, kita sama-sama sambut dan ikuti perkembangan karya-karya teknologi baru di sekitar kita!

https://medium.com/@Calvium/building-for-the-future-digital-transformation-in-the-construction-industry-68bf73bc61e1?source=tag_archive---------149-----------------------,Building for the future: Digital transformation in the construction industry,Written by Calvium,Calvium,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Calvium Follow -- Listen Share Profit margins globally are also the lowest of any industry, save for retail. Traditionally, the UK has also faced similar problems but in recent years the country has made positive changes — and digital transformation is central to this change. In fact, digital will arguably define the future of the industry — from planning to logistics, manufacturing to transportation. So what are the current and future trends in the industry, and what role does app technology play? These offsite factories significantly reduce the level of on-site labour intensity and risk — saving money, improving efficiency and offering greater quality control. To work properly, however, it requires the integration of digital technology. Phil Wilbraham, programme director at Heathrow , believes that digital engineering, combined with offsite construction, is the key to not only the Heathrow expansion, but to saving the British construction industry. He explains: “Our job as client is to create an environment to design really creatively. To allow all the great ideas and creativity to come through in a timely manner. And how do we do that more efficiently? Using offsite construction and then assembling it onsite using digital engineering.” He does stress, however, that they need support, adding: “There are enough people out there talking about changing how we deliver projects, and about digital engineering. We’ve got a massive opportunity here, but we can’t do it alone — we need the industry to help with that.” He’s right, of course. The industry as a whole needs to be on board with digital innovation. This is particularly true of offsite manufacturing, where a million and one moving parts and conversations happen simultaneously. More dispersed teams require collaborative working tools and communication methods to ensure projects are properly aligned. Having control over the entire supply chain allows for greater integration of processes and data flows in one cohesive system. Digital platforms are ideal to manage the end-to-end process of design, manufacturing and installation (including asset tracking and accessibility via smart device app integration). The value of offsite manufacturing is undeniable, but it brings with it plenty of challenges. Every one of those challenges — from planning to logistics to communication — can be tackled by digital technology. Offsite or on, there are a vast number of people involved in a typical construction project. Planners, site managers, third-party suppliers and the crew are all parts of a larger machine, and those parts change daily. Without great communication, the machine can’t run at full efficiency. This isn’t just about checking emails or sending direct messages to each other on site (although that comes into it). Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an established approach, supporting key stakeholders in the construction process — enhancing productivity, sharing info, monitoring progress. It’s certainly not universally adopted as a standard practice but as large scale construction projects tend more to digital, it undoubtedly will be. Of course, to reach all the key stakeholders, both on-site and off, BIM needs to be accessible to all. It’s becoming more and more common to see site workers with iPads and tablets, not to mention the fact that most construction workers have a smartphone on them already. This makes communication and planning far easier than ever before, creating a connected network of people all reading from the same sheets, monitoring progress in real-time. On May 2, an official advisory panel drew up Britain’s eco-friendly battle plan. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) made its mission clear: to eliminate net emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050 in the UK. As a sector that consumes around half of the planet’s raw material output and contributes around 50% of European carbon emissions , the construction industry has its work cut out. With the lines already drawn, it’s not an option for new construction projects to ‘think green’ anymore, it’s a necessity to ‘do green’. The industry is responding: a recent government survey revealed a 14% growth in the number of construction stakeholders who expect more than 60% of their projects to be green. But there’s still a long way to go. The Internet of Things or 3D printing can help efficiency, sure, but also reduce waste and costs. As the technology improves, sites will never overestimate construction materials, and never have to wastefully fabricate specific parts for builds. Added to that, data gathering and analysis could have positive knock-on effects in construction for decades. The industry is constantly looking for new materials to build with — more cost effective without risking public safety. Data analysis of materials over time, and over multiple sites, can give valuable insight into what is truly effective. What materials are long-lasting and effective? Which ones need repair? Digital technologies supporting the management of buildings will give us better understanding the qualities of materials to support the push for sustainability. Funded projects have also explored how voice-activated Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality can be integrated with the assembly of components to speed up construction and increase productivity, without compromising health and safety. In addition, UK Research and Innovation has also announced that £13.3 million will be used to fund 24 collaborative research and development projects, delivered by Innovate UK. Construction Minister, Richard Harrington , said: “The use of Artificial Intelligence, digital techniques and off-site manufacturing help us harness new methods of working. This delivers on the Government’s Construction Sector Deal which pledges to build better performing buildings, using less energy and providing better value for taxpayers.” According to The Economist , if the productivity growth of the construction sector had matched that of the manufacturing sector in the last 20 years, the world would be $1.6 trillion better off each year. So, the challenges might be great, but the rewards are even greater. It might not necessarily be a case of “ modernise or die ,” as Jozef thinks, but perhaps it’s time to start thinking about construction 2.0.

HOST：Allen Li Allen Li is Chief Architect and co-founder at QLC Chain. Previously, Allen worked at Huawei Technologies for 7 years and had a startup offering a virtual sim product for 4 years. On Oct 30, 8pm HKT, Allen conducted AMA with Cybex users in China via WeChat. The AMA lasted for over 90 mins, talking about how QLC Chain builds a blockchain-based global communication resource trading platform in China in the 5G era. The following translation gives a review of the AMA content, divided into five major parts according to the order of the questions. 1.1 About QLC Chain QLC Chain is to resolve the data trust and security problem in the communication industry, and aim to build a public chain for Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) platform. 1.2 QLC Chain business implementation stages The first stage is the front-end application — mobile topup, supporting the digital currency like QLC and other digital assets as the recharge method. The second phase is the back-end billing of communication services. Currently, we are cooperating with the largest cloud communication partners in China and a fixed network operator in Hong Kong. The third stage is to form a network operator crowdfunding platform. The user’s mobile purchases are distributed in real-time after QLC Chain clearing, and real-time dividends are given to early global supporters. Mainly implemented across the chain on QLC/ETH. The fourth phase is to provide tool development based on this operating platform, supporting the QLC Chain global community, and forming a Defi platform based on communications data and digital asset collateral. 1.3 Two examples of application scenarios: Scenario 1: QLC chain to help foreigners in China to use WeChat to make payment Scenario 2: QLC Chain supports partners to establish a non-roaming communication network + payment network in the border trade area The development of QLC Chain has been mainly driven by technology-based product development over the past two years. From 2020 onwards, we will fully develop our business and promote implementation. Find more about the Go-QLC dual consensus via medium.com 2. QLC product ecosystem A user can encrypt private SMS, email, images and WeChat chats within the app, meanwhile, create a local vault for private communication and storing private files. 3. Future usage scenarios and further applications Q-Wallet is a mobile wallet in the QLC Chain ecosystem which aims to build an open communication resource marketplace globally. At the first stage, users can recharge mobile plans for all Chinese communication service providers with up to 5% off. At the second stage, the wallet can support more GAS-like token backed by a variety of crypto tokens staking economy, such as ERC-20 tokens, as utility fuel for mobile communication service to fulfill the 1.4 trillion mobile plan top upmarket requirement in China and as utility fuel for top-up receipts issued by QLC Chain. At the third stage, Q-Wallet will be expanding the communication service adoption for crypto tokens from mobile plans to a variety of cloud communication services including video call/internet speed up/CDN/IP address proxy/IoT devices. 4. 5G and blockchain technology combined, what role will QLC play, and what is the application scenario like? On October 31, 2019, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology officially joined forces with the three major operators and the China Tower Company to announce the launch of 5G services. The combination of QLC and 5G is an inheritance relationship from the 4G network. In addition, the 5G SA core network products supported by QLC are already in the development stage. In the 5G era, QLC Chain nodes and smart contracts will be deployed directly at the core network level of the communication network, automatically handling various business requirements related to 5G, such as 1. Tackling the Internet of Vehicles’ (IoV) traceability, latency and assetization of the log data. 2. Depreciation calculation through equipment data in all IoT networks 3. In the VR scenario, authenticate the ID of the digital content generated, and counter fraud. 4.

The tight placement of the passive components meant that if there was any problems during reflow it was very difficult to get a soldering iron in…” “…I omitted ISCP programming pads because I figured it would be fine to program the chip using magnet wire to the pins. This was a terrible and error prone idea. Put programming pads on your board, you are only making your own life more difficult!

Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Amazon had purchased an Israeli tech firm and that Israeli high-tech companies raised a record $6.47 billion last year. Israel’s tech sector has played a key role in doubling the nation’s share of GDP from 6 percent in 1995 to about 12 percent today. It’s also played a significant incubator role to some of the most disruptive tech brands. Wearing the proud moniker of “Startup Nation,” Israelis have the largest number of startups per capita in the world (1 for every 1,400 people) and have developed technologies acquired by Google and Intel. It’s no wonder firms are investing in innovation overseas. We’re no exception. That’s because Israeli start-ups have a track-record for solving thorny and complex problems that impact industries and infrastructure; Next47’s sweet spot. We’re doubling-down on our commitment to this ecosystem by opening a new office in Israel, led by Moshe Zilberstein who just joined us from Norwest Venture Partners. We’re also pleased to introduce our newest portfolio company, Israel-based Bringg. Bringg is driving innovation in an industry as old as commerce itself: Logistics. Logistics is having its time in the spotlight in 2019. Ensuring goods get from Point A to Point B in a timely, efficient manner is an omnipresent priority, as consumers and business alike have real-time delivery data at their fingertips. According to the annual State of Logistics Report, spending on logistics in the U.S. rose to $1.5 trillion in 2017, which represents 7.7 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. In terms of revenue, research indicates the global logistics market will grow from $8.1 trillion in 2015 to $15.5 trillion by 2023. The same technology that can deliver a pizza to your home in 30 minutes can now deliver a shirt to you in the same amount of time. This is often called the “Amazon effect,” and it’s changed the way we look at logistics, particularly what’s called “last-mile delivery.” As consumers have seen with Amazon, how we shop today is a far cry from how we shopped even 10 years ago: No one expected next-day shipping from retailers, nor did they expect the visibility of knowing exactly and reliably when those goods would arrive. Today, that precision and reliability is the expected norm. But if you’re not Amazon, how can you achieve that same level of transparency, reliability and efficiency? That’s where Bringg comes in. Bringg provides enterprises with the most efficient way of managing complex delivery operations. Some of the world’s best-known brands (including Walmart, Panera Bread and AutoZone) in more than 50 countries are already gaining clear strategic value from Bringg’s powerful SaaS platform which offers the real-time capabilities organizations need in order to achieve logistical excellence across delivery ecosystems. We’re thrilled to invest in Bringg and help them deliver on their mission to fundamentally transform the centuries-old logistics industry.

https://medium.com/@bzargesg/why-traditional-scientists-make-good-developers-49fccfb0960e?source=tag_archive---------100-----------------------,Why Traditional Scientists Make Good Developers,Written by Bevan Zarges-Griego,Bevan Zarges-Griego,No Author URL,N/A,5 min read,"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Bevan Zarges-Griego Follow -- Listen Share An interesting thing happened to me the other day. Someone asked me how my background as a biochemist contributed to my current career as developer. I used the opportunity to talk about my rigorous approach to problems and my ability to wade through documentation and find the relevant bits. While I like my answer well enough, frankly this question has been keeping me up at night. So why do scientists make good developers? What on earth is the correlation between biochemistry (or any science) and software development? What makes a good developer? 1. Proving it: Test Driven Development(TDD) I have a saying that I abide by: “A real scientist proves their assumptions.” Whether this means finding a credible source or setting out to prove a hypothesis, scientific contributions come when the scientific community can be convinced that a hypothesis is correct. The software engineer translation is TDD. I could go so far as to say: “A real programmer proves their code with testing.” I also feel that as a scientist I have a knack or training to ask, “This looks cool, where can it break? What part of this is wrong?” I dislike when I find out my approach was flawed from the beginning of a project. Not only should a developer be thinking about how to prove and ensure that the code they are pushing out is functionable, but they should also be thinking of ways to break it in order for it to stand up to those cases. 2. Communication: What are you doing? An interesting problem has been arising in the scientific circles, a dirty little word: “reproducibility.” Groups have been trying to reproduce published works and have had little to moderate success in reproducing results. Recently, I took on a project at the midway point. I wasted two weeks attempting to reproduce the previous results before finally just giving up and going back to the drawing board. How does this transfer over to software development? Communicating your approach, methods, or comments in your code is the only way to let somebody (possibly you) know how or what you were thinking at that moment. Understanding the need to consistently communicate technically is a powerful skill. 3. Pragmatism: The minimum viable product One of the most interesting things I remember thinking while walking into my first lab was how many interesting little money-saving tricks were used on equipment worth half a million dollars. A company making millions a year was using 200 year old techniques and making a profit while using Walmart containers. The point of this example is pragmatism: do what works. The goal isn’t to make everything look nice and be perfect, but to produce results. Without a product or final endpoint, your work has no value (granted there is a conversation here about tech debt). 4. Jargon: And getting used to it We live in a world of jargon; singleton, higher order function, lambda, closures, etc… The unfortunate truth is these descriptions are necessary for deep level conversations about specific topics. With science, it is not much different. I used to participate in a journal club where everyone would get a scientific paper and try to present it in five minutes. Biochemistry has a wide range of topics ranging from proteins of various names to metabolic pathways, and memorizing the jargon is no simple task. I feel like eventually you either learn how to break down a word “|nicotinic| |acetyl|choline |receptor|,” learn the context, or become proficient in looking it up. Learning a new library, framework, or technology is the same way. You can see how it is used, compare it to other things, or learn it from the documentation at your disposal. 5. Learning new things The world seems to constantly move forward in regards to technology. Biochemistry was no exception. Don’t get me wrong. Some of the technologies can have a slow adoption journey, but constant learning is important for scientists and software engineers alike. Ten years ago it was Backbone and today it is React.JS; ten years ago we weren’t using CRISPR for gene editing. Technology moves forward, agnostic to field. 6. Fail and Learn Earlier I referenced not being able to reproduce the results of another group. While I didn’t reproduce the data, I did learn a tremendous amount about using an HPLC and designing tests with that instrument. I find that my journey in software development has been similar. While learning to use webpack for an early React.js project, I botched the webpack config and ended up familiarizing myself more with webpack. Through that failure I learned about how webpack works and gained a deeper understanding about what the various parts do. Scientists try to learn from their mistakes and produce, or refine, their methods from those failures. So why do scientists make good developers — or for that matter, what makes a good developer? I think strong developers possess the ability to learn quickly, adapt, and produce results. My background in science has provided me a smooth transition into the world of software engineering. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*B41s336-4MXSFrPs.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*B41s336-4MXSFrPs.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*B41s336-4MXSFrPs.jpg"

Throughout my career, I’ve felt like I’ve lived in two worlds — the exciting world of technology and the world of my beautiful Latino community. My work as a Tech Executive gave me the opportunity to grow as an emerging leader, to lead C-level initiatives, and to live in cities around the world. My volunteer work with young students in East San Jose gave me the opportunity to impact lives and bring others along on this journey with me. I wanted to explore how to bring these worlds closer together and decided to leave my job as an executive to go back to school. I was accepted to the Stanford Graduate School of Business MSx Program. At the GSB I would have the opportunity to dedicate a year to my personal transformation — and explore how to become an executive who brings her heart and mind together for maximum social impact. At the GSB, I gained a more strategic view of business, learned how to become more influential, and emerge as an authentic leader who can inspire innovation. Through classes like Strategy Beyond Markets, Formation of New Ventures, and Entrepreneurship from Diverse Perspective, I gained a deeper understanding of how to shift from managing a department to leading a company — how to engage with board members, customers, and employees. By working with professors such as Saumitra Jha, Rob Siegel, and Fern Mandelbaum, I gained a deeper understanding of the complex issues that leaders face and more importantly how to create the space to rapidly prototype the best ways to address those challenges. One of my goals at Stanford was to learn how to foster an environment where people feel inspired to drive innovation and to influence change. Through classes like Interpersonal Dynamics (“Touchy Feely”), Paths to Power, and Managing Difficult Conversations, I discovered new ways to think about leadership. I learned how to lean into my own personal style and to adjust to different environments. I learned from leaders like Eric Schmidt, chairman of Alphabet to “use the word imagine as a prefix… never stop learning and exploring” My cohort consisted of 90 individuals from ~40 different countries. It was a unique opportunity to explore different cultures and learn from individuals on different career paths — Rocket Scientists, US Army Colonels, Non-Profit Leaders, Government Officials, Tech Executives, Venture Capitalists, and Serial Entrepreneurs. I was curious about the intersection of technology and impact. Stanford gave me the tools and the space to explore what a career in social innovation could look like. I learned what it was like to be a non-profit executive, to launch a social enterprise, and to be an impact investor. I was selected to be part of the Social Impact Venture Capital Fund team where I had the opportunity to source, evaluate, and invest in social impact startups. Through a global study trip, I was able to learn about the social, political and economic landscape of Mexico. I had the privilege to meet with leaders like Carlos Slim, President Calderon, and President Salinas. One of the discussion points I was eager to engage in was the lack of opportunity and impact it had on immigration. It was not lost on me that I would not be sitting in the room with these leaders had my family not immigrated to the United States. I also wanted to explore what being a Latina in Silicon Valley means — and how I can be an advocate for change. I was incredibly honored to be a part of the LOW keynote program where I was given the platform to describe the challenges that many Latino families face, the beautiful entrepreneurial spirit of my East San Jose community, and the need to create more opportunities for people from a different path. Through coaches like JD Schramm and Linda Capello, I learned the power of storytelling and that being vulnerable with your audience could have a profound impact. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2S96vaCKGs The GSB provides the flexibility to design your own class. I developed an independent study of “Latino Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders”. Through this class, I was able to learn from Latinos who were paving the way in technology — Venture Capitalists, Startup Founders, C-Level Executives, and even an Astronaut. Miriam Rivera, the former General Counsel at Google who launched her own venture fund, Ullu Ventures showed me how to bold and embrace my culture. She challenged me to always look for the intersection of our two worlds — where I could help pave the way and have a positive impact on the world. My experience at Stanford was life-changing. It gave me the time and space to explore the next phase of my career. I gained new perspectives, developed new friendships, and worked in an environment that allowed me to lean into a career that will have a much bigger impact on the world. In my next article, I’ll dive into my path after Stanford.

So I was pretty outraged when, in 2011, my iPhone went without me. I think it’s only fair to place around 5 percent of the blame on my friend Blair. A group of us were in a London wine bar pretending to be grown-ups, searching for more sophisticated ways to say “second-least-expensive bottle” while tossing around wine terms we’d heard in a semi-ironic attempt to impress our waiter. “Oaky.” “Fruity.” “Hmm… chewy.” What actually did impress him, however, was Blair, a man so charming he wins people over basically just by being present. The waiter rewarded his charm by bringing us the leftover wine from other people’s tables after they’d left; a quarter bottle here, a half bottle here.

There are many intricacies to the system, but I believe these are the main mechanisms in place if one wants a brief overview of how Maker gives Dai its stablecoin properties. Even though cryptocurrency has progressed significantly since its inception, a few crucial problems are blocking its adoption as a real-world currency. One problem being: price fluctuations of a single coin can drastically change in a day, let alone an hour. Could you imagine having USD or CAD fluctuate hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars in an hour while you are trying to pay rent or buy groceries? You could go from having the appropriate amount of USD for rent of $1200, then suddenly it is now worth $900 dollars. Cryptocurrency saw a significant boost in popularity during the bull run of 2017. This caused a lot of hype and fear-of-missing-out to sweep across investors, creating a domino effect of other investors buying in as the price of many cryptocurrencies skyrocketed— which only helped boost prices even higher. However, what goes up must come down. The market started falling rapidly during the early months of 2018 as investors became weary of the current valuations of cryptocurrencies, and most of them weren’t exactly sure what they were getting themselves into. There is a small percentage of investors who buy into cryptocurrency due to its technological fundamentals, but it is not enough to change the current trend of pure-hype investment. Imagine if investing in cryptocurrency could guarantee steady returns, offered minimal risk of losing your initial investment, and helped make history by supporting a technology that you believed could make a difference in the world. And for those who enjoy riding the highs and lows of the cryptocurrency market, you could still participate in high-risk, high-reward endeavours while your initial investment was safe. The Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) is a financial cryptocurrency concept that has been in development since 2014 by the MakerDAO project, which offers a possible solution to the high volatility that cryptocurrency faces today through the stablecoin known as Dai. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to another stable asset. Pegging is the practice of fixing the exchange rate of one currency to the value of another currency. In this case, the Dai stablecoin is pegged to the US dollar. Having a stablecoin opens up many new financial possibilities for this burgeoning sector that were not possible before due to volatility. Not only does Dai offer stabilization, but is also offers transparency and decentralization, since it is built on top of the Ethereum network. Now, back to CDPs. There are many mechanisms in place that ensure that Dai stays relative to the US dollar. Maker offers a smart contract platform on the Ethereum blockchain that backs and stabilizes Dai through a series of dynamic feedback systems called CDPs, which also help to facilitate an efficient decentralized margin trading platform. With a CDP, a user deposits an asset into a smart contract as collateral for a loan. Once the CDP holds the assets deposited by a user, the user can then generate the equivalent USD value in Dai that they wish to borrow. Users can then do anything they want with Dai, just like any other cryptocurrency. They can trade Dai, use it for payments, or even use it as a personal savings account — there are no restrictions to using Dai, it can be use the same way you would use any other cryptocurrency. Since Dai is pegged to the US dollar, you will always only owe back what you initially borrowed in addition to interest. For example, let’s say you deposit 2 ETH (at moment of writing, ETH is worth $105 USD) into a CDP and borrow 100 Dai: You would have to pay 100 Dai back plus accumulated interest, and you get back your full 2 ETH. Currently, there are other systems you can use to borrow other non-stable coins, but with the current market volatility, you could end up owing twice as much as your initial investment. Let’s say you deposited 10 AssetCoins, and then generated 100 NonStableCoin(NSC) to be borrowed at their current market price of $2 USD. If the price of NSC has dropped to $1 USD when you go back to repay the loan, you would now owe 200 NSC plus accumulated interest. As you can see, this is a great benefit for any investor: what you owe will always be clear and certain. In another example, let’s say you want to invest in the very high-risk AmazingICO(AICO) but you do not want to send in your ETH and potentially lose it all. You could deposit 10 ETH into a CDP (at time of writing, that is $1050 USD), generate the equivalent in Dai, and then send that 1050 Dai to the AICO. Let’s say AICO crashes and you want to cut your losses, so you sell AICO back into Dai, but now you only have $800 worth of Dai. Good news though! You still have your 10 ETH safe in a CDP. In order to retrieve your ETH, you would have to find a way to recuperate the $250 USD to pay off your loan plus interest, but you’re happy that you didn’t lose ETH since while you were waiting for your ICO to increase in value, the price of ETH has been skyrocketing, so now your 10 ETH is now worth $2100! That was enough to offset your losses in AICO. Imagine if instead of setting up a CDP, you actually sent in ETH to AICO, you could have lost 2 ETH, which would have meant losing $420. Setting up a CDP and using Dai as your method of investment can be the difference between either doubling your loses or doubling your profits. Of course, there will always be risk with investments, so you must be diligent in your research and strategies. The deposited assets inside a CDP can only be retrieved once the user has paid back the same amount of Dai that they initially borrowed. However, generating the initial CDP to borrow Dai also accrues interest, so the user must pay back the Dai they borrowed plus generated interest to retrieve their assets. Active CDPs must always hold a higher collateral value than the value of debt the user has. Otherwise, CDPs that hold less value in collateral than they do in debt might be at risk to be liquidated and sold off. Dai initially launched with support for only one collateral, which was Pooled Ether, also known as PETH. In order for users to obtain PETH to use as collateral for a CDP, they first had to deposit their ETH into a smart contract that pools ETH, which then gave them the equivalent amount in PETH. The purpose of using Pooled ETH was so that if the market for ETH crashed, the CDP would be able to retain a higher value of collateral than debt. If ETH crashed, the debt in a CDP would be worth more than the collateral held. Maker would then have the ability to recapitalize the market by automatically decreasing the supply of PETH, which would increase demand and, in turn, increase the price of Dai. This then increases the value of the collateral in a CDP and decreases the overall value of debt. Maker is able to make Dai a Stablecoin due to its Target Rate Feedback Mechanism (TRFM). The TRFM is an automatic mechanism that the Dai Stablecoin System employs in order to maintain stability. The Target Price of 1 Dai is $1 USD, so the Target Rate determines the needed change of price of Dai over time in order to reach the Target Price during a market swing. However, when the TRFM engages, the fixed peg ratio of 1 DAI to $1 USD breaks, but it is required in order to get the price of Dai back to where it needs to be. For example, if the Target Price of Dai is below $1 USD, the TRFM increases so that it can push the price of Dai back up. This causes the price of Dai to increase, which then causes the generation of Dai through CDPs to become more expensive. Simultaneously, this also causes users who hold Dai to gain profit, leading to an increase in demand for Dai. The combination of increased demand for the coin causes a reduced supply of Dai in the market, as users lower the supply of Dai as they borrow it through CDPs and buy from the market, they cause the price of Dai to be pushed back up to its Target Price. The TRFM and Target Rate are determined by market supply and demand dynamics. However, Maker voters can also set the Sensitivity Parameter of the TRFM. The Sensitivity Parameter determines how mild or severe the response of the Target Rate Feedback Mechanism should be when the Target Price of Dai has deviated from where it should be. For example, if the Sensitivity Parameter is defined as “10% in 15 minutes” by Maker voters, then the Target Rate cannot change the price of the market by more than 10% within a span of 15 minutes. This means that the maximum hourly change in price of Dai that the TRFM can make is 40% from where Dai was at the beginning of the hour. This restriction ensures that there is enough time to trigger a global settlement in the event that an attacker gains control over a majority of the oracles. The Sensitivity Parameter is set by Maker Voters so that if the Oracles were ever hacked, Maker Voters would be able could set the Sensitivity Parameter as low as possible to limit the speed of which the price of Dai could change, which would give the network enough time to trigger a global settlement. The Maker Platform requires real-time information to be fed into the system in order for the autonomous procedure to work properly. This ensures that collaterals in CDPs are worth more than the debt accrued in them; if not, TRFM kick’s in to level the price of Dai. Maker always wants the collateralized assets to be worth more than the debt incurred by users. The protocol can liquidate CDPs if the collateralized assets within them are deemed to be “risky.” In this case, liquidating them would ensure that the CDP can cut its losses. The Maker Platform also requires oracles to relay real-time information to the system about market price in order to adjust the Target Rate when TRFM is engaged. A Global Settlement is a last resort process to guarantee the Target Price to the holders of Dai. When a Global Settlement is triggered, it shuts down the system. This means that holders of Dai and CDP users receive the net value of assets that they are entitled to. The process is fully decentralized and Maker voters govern the access to it in the case of an emergency. Oracles and Global Settlers are known as Key External Actors that help keep Dai’s price stable. They are external actors since they do not live within the protocol but, rather, live around it to help keep Dai safe. Another type of Key External Actor are Keepers. Keepers are usually automated and independent actors who are incentivized by profitable opportunities to contribute to decentralized systems. Keepers can also make profit trading Dai; when the market price of Dai is higher than Target Price, keepers sell to increase supply and decrease demand, which lowers the price of Dai back to its Target Price. Keepers also buy Dai when the price is below $1 USD to lower supply, which increases demand for the coin, in turn helping push Dai’s price back up to where it needs to be. As any company would, Maker strives to ensure that the operation of this system is as secure as possible, but there are always potential risks. However, Maker is consistently developing new ways to benefit the community and perfect its stablecoin system. Maker addresses a crucial problem in today’s Ethereum ecosystem: The price of cryptocurrency is too volatile to be today’s everyday currency.

At Augmania, we’ve been researching AR for years. We would like to celebrate college students who devoted their diligent efforts to creating special projects using AR. Some of the projects are super exciting hints at what the future holds, while others we’re sure will serve as an inspiration to fellow content creators reading right now. So here goes: Earlier this year, NASA invited students from many universities to apply to its S.U.I.T.S Design Challenge program in which students would design and create space suit information displays within an AR environment. A team of different majors from Bradley University and MIT among other universities was ultimately selected to take the lead. The undergraduates said they couldn’t believe it when NASA asked for their help in developing the AR project. But that didn’t overwhelm them or stop them from innovating throughout the project. Working on Microsoft’s HoloLens and using input from NASA astronauts, the students came up with many impressive features for the suit. One of them allows astronauts to read instructions and view important diagrams through their facemasks. And if astronauts needed a clear view, an AI assistant could provide them with all the information they need. The astronaut will eventually use The AR program to facilitate communication between them and the ground control as they take spacewalks. Stanford students, Max Korman, and Khoi Lee, had been observing the proven positive effect AR had on areas such as education. Nevertheless, they wanted to experiment with the use of AR in a narrative so they decided to create the first-ever short film using AR as a medium: Snowbird. Snowbird tells the story of a bird stuck in a snow globe with an old ill-tempered snowman. The movie debuted at the Stanford Immersive Media Conference to much praise from attendees. However, anyone who wants to watch it now can simply download the Snowbird app and layer the snow globe over any flat surface to start the viewing experience. Kiwi is an AR app that makes learning easier for high school students. The School of Visual Arts and Columbia University students recalled how some high schools were lagging behind in terms of tech when they themselves were high schoolers. They created Kiwi to be a weapon to all bored students. They can use whenever they want to learn in more engaging ways. As students scan their textbooks using Kiwi, they unlock videos and other forms of content that provide extra info. This can make topics more interesting and more fun to learn. The app also allows features such as note-taking and highlighting to encourage sharing among students. The app won the NYC Media Lab Verizon Challenge 2017 in the category of AR/MR. The Washington College Archives has a rich selection of artifacts from different chapters in the history of USA. Visiting the exhibition is a great opportunity to learn more about the country’s history and remember its past. The problem is with how busy their lives have become today. Some students of The Washington College didn’t find a journey to the Archives too engaging. It didn’t take the people in charge of the Archives long to figure out that solving this problem had to involve new tech. This is why they decided to use AR. They then left it to a team of students who took it all from there in what they called The Augmented Archives Project. They developed an app that gives users a 3D model of the item scanned. This allows users to interact with it in any way they like. In addition, they added to the experience videos and text to educate them about the history of the item. Other than turning students into history experts, The Augmented Archives Project is also a signal to how students may interact with materials they are researching while working on papers and projects in the future. In 2017, MIT students Julia Rue, Tara Lee, Jessie Wang, Emma DeSoto, and Iris Fung who used to enjoy doing art before joining college set on to resurrect their passion for art with a series of 200 foot long murals inside tunnels and invited all MIT students to join them in creating the murals; a project they dubbed The Borderline Murals. The tunnels where the murals were painted had been used before for protection against bad weather. That’s why they were quite useful even if they were bland. The project leaders wanted to change that and make the tunnels a place people anticipate and enjoy going to. To make that happen, they believed that art was not enough so they integrated AR into the project. Scanning the murals using the BorderlineAR app brought the murals to life. It also unlocked extra content to tell the stories of the murals. Addition of an AR element made the visit to the tunnels a much more engaging experience. This helped the project achieve its goal of increasing the art’s appreciation. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*dAaUAB1pSYcxZhdDRwDazA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*dAaUAB1pSYcxZhdDRwDazA.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*dAaUAB1pSYcxZhdDRwDazA.jpeg"

Unfortunately, cybercrime has grown alongside our valued technological advances, and now, it has made its way from targeting established corporations to affecting virtually anyone that is connected to the internet. We have left ourselves more vulnerable than ever to being exposed to and losing control of our digital accounts. Amidst this change, many businesses have increased their investments into cybersecurity programs and protocols to defend against cybercriminals. However, the root cause of many cyber crimes today is more often than not, human error. Without properly educating technology users on the risks of using online applications and platforms, it will be hard to continually defend against the evolving tactics employed by cybercriminals. Here we will examine why human error has become such an integral part of the cybercrime space and why this is a core issue that needs to be addressed. It is hard to deny that the increasing connectivity resulting from uploading our lives onto the web has vastly increased the general public’s exposure to cyber crimes. Current statistics in cybercrime are staggering to say the least, with cybercrime estimated to affect more than 780,000 records everyday, not to mention the estimated global cost of $600 billion per year. With cybercrime becoming such a lucrative business, it is no surprise that it has attracted the attention of organized crime gangs who are now carrying out sophisticated planned attacks against people at scale. With the ability to efficiently scale such operations, cybercriminals are no longer only targeting large, established corporations. Verizon’s 2018 Data Breach Investigations Report found that “58% of all malware victims were small businesses.” By taking advantage of smaller teams with fewer IT technicians, cybercriminals have found a profitable strategy that can be easily replicated and has proven to be even more lucrative than large-scale, targeted efforts. Additionally, because small businesses don’t usually have the funds to pursue legal action after these attacks, they are generally weaker opponents that can be more easily manipulated than established corporations. Through this shift, cybercriminals have found new ways to infiltrate small businesses, specifically through email communication, a tool used by almost every single employee. Currently, phishing and malware are two of the fastest growing sectors within cybercrime, and the use of email communication has been central to its growth. It is estimated that currently, 92% of malware is delivered by email, showing the relatively high success rate of delivering attacks through email. The completion of these attacks depends on whether or not the potential victim can notice minute differences in these emails. A growth in email-based attacks signifies a shift towards victims that are less technologically informed and oftentimes careless. This is rooted in a lack of education as well as a minimal understanding of the risks involved in online transactions. Studies have shown that there is a systemic lack of education within workplaces when it comes to cybersecurity. According to a 2017 survey from MediaPro, 7 out of 10 employees “exhibited behaviors that put their organizations at risk of a privacy or security incident.” While that is an improvement from the previous year, in reality, attackers only need to persuade one employee to give up account information to carry out a complete attack. For example, in the Target hack that affected 70 million customers, the hacker was able to infiltrate their system by carrying out a successful email phishing campaign through one of their vendors. The mistake of one employee at this vendor ended up affecting millions of customers at an affiliated business. Additionally, many people are unaware of the risks that come with their daily online interactions. Businesses and consumers have gotten used to storing their data on the cloud and don’t always think about the implications of the hundreds of digital transactions they take part in daily. One of the reasons that human error contributing to cyberattacks is rampant across industries is that employees don’t think about potential risks when they sign-in to a new website or open emails in their business inbox. When people are unaware of how a simple online interaction can turn into a large-scale hack, they are less likely to put the effort into double-checking content before sharing important information that could result in successful hacks. Phishing and malware are both methods that completely depend on the victim to make easy mistakes, whether that is giving out credentials on a fake landing page or downloading an infected file. As much as sophisticated cyber security systems can filter out suspicious communications, education for users is essential to protecting their accounts from hackers, especially when their reach is ever-increasing. By properly educating employees and the general public on cybersecurity best practices, we can collectively take a big step towards a more secure and safe future.

Since more than half of US consumers prefer e-commerce over brick-and-mortar stores, close to 40% plan to start checking off Santa’s list by Halloween, according to the latest survey by Deloitte. A big driver for 72% of Internet customers is free shipping, which leads to a hiring and tech boom at warehouses across the continent. Logistics in America is one of the fastest-growing private sectors of the economy, generating more than $1.6 trillion of spending (or close to 10% of GDP) in the supply chain, transportation, and distribution investments. Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) accounts for $5 billion alone, resulting from the increasing demands of web fulfillment. ABI Research states in its WMS report: “The continued growth of the e-commerce market and rising customer expectations are putting enormous pressure on warehouses to execute more rapid and flexible deliveries. This is driving investment in warehouse facilities, automation technologies, and warehouse management systems to coordinate and optimize operations.” Almost parallel with the growth of WMS is venture capital’s investment into the category. Earlier today Fabric (formerly Commonsense Robotics) announced it had closed a Series B financing round of $136 million, after raising $20 million the year prior. The company boasts of a platform to deploy “micro-fulfillment centers” using its proprietary artificially intelligent rovers to move goods around the distribution center to human employees. According to Steve Hornyak, Fabric’s Chief Commercial Officer, “It [Fabric] enables retailers that don’t have the resources or infrastructure to build an entirely new fulfillment operation themselves to access a world-class logistics solution that enables profitable on-demand fulfillment.” www.datadriveninvestor.com This is welcome news as a fraction of the 400,000 warehouses in the United States are automated; in 2016 it was estimated that only 10% were fully mechanized. A big hurdle is the cost of upgrading these large facilities that could be three football fields in length or $2 to $20 million in robots depending on the square footage. Fabric, while convenient for specialty retail, still leaves the door wide open for market disruption, especially by innovators that leverage existing processes to steer automation. Every warehouse uses pallets to stack and move goods around their facility, globally there are more than 2 billion pallets in existence with half a billion new ones made each year. The Global Pallet market is expected to increase to $25 billion incrementally over the next five years with the adoption of more environmentally-friendly reusable plastic materials. Given that distribution managers purchase or rent pallets every day, the value proposition of adding inexpensive technology to this existing storage platform could be a game-changer in revolutionizing the industry. This idea was first proposed to me last week at New York University’s Endless Frontier Labs by Atle Timenes, the founder of wheel.me. Timenes impressed me by illustrating how his Nordic startup plans on reinventing a 5,500-year-old invention — the wheel. In speaking further with Timenes he explained the origins of the epiphany, “Our journey started with the inventor Rolf Libakken (his co-founder) helping his family move several times during a short period. The obvious question when moving heavy objects was, ‘why aren’t these things on wheels?’ A mechanical ‘click-wheel’ was invented, much like the principles of a ballpoint pen, serving also as wheel.me’s first commercial product.” This click-wheel castor was invented in 2013, which added manual rolling motion to any static object. Fast forward a few years Timenes and his team upgraded their patented solution by stuffing a motor, gearing, batteries and vision sensors into their cylindrical sleeve. Unlike other robo-solutions that charge upwards of thousands of dollars a unit, wheel.me offers a modest monthly subscription of ten Euro’s per wheel. The monthly fee for “wheel.me Genius” product includes access to its dashboard that enables non-technical managers to synchronize all their wheels in motion. “Positioning and navigation data are sent and received from the cloud. The system can run on Wi-Fi or a local network. Data science capabilities are added for a backend/cloud solution and with swarm-enabling technology wheel.me can perform coordinated movements with a large number of objects,” Timenes describes. The total available market opportunity for wheel.me Genius is huge, upwards of $170 billion a month, as each pallet would contain 8 castors. The Oslo roboticist expounded, “Automation is rapidly changing the landscape for businesses. Still, early adoption could lead to risks affecting financials, quality, safety, and process. wheel.me Genius takes down entry barriers to adopt automation technologies due to orders of magnitude lower costs and charging according to an indoor-mobility-as-a-service model, making pay-back and Return-on-Investment (RoI) highly attractive.” I pressed Timenes on how he plans to compete against larger competitors that utilize Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), he retorted, “Existing solutions require frequent human intervention to load/offload and manage the object being lifted, dragged or pushed. wheel.me finds it counterintuitive that objects that already are fitted with wheels (or easily could be fitted with wheels) should need a ‘device on wheels’ (AGV or AMR) to be able to move them.” He continued, “In line with the classic description of a disruptive innovation, we believe that current suppliers of automated indoor mobility and materials handling solutions are on a performance trajectory that is tailored to the high-end of the market. wheel.me Genius initially might be less attractive than existing competitors based on traditional performance parameters — power, speed, and lifting capacity — while they will add new performance parameters to completely alter the competition — in this case flexibility from making any object smart and set for autonomous movement, and orders of magnitude lower costs.” Making any object smart could include anything with wheels from event chairs to parking systems to manufacturing equipment to (of course) billions of pallets. The optimism of Timenes is grounded in the increasing significance of the Scandinavian robot ecosystem that made headlines this summer with a series of prominent acquisitions. In June, USA private equity firm Thomas H. Lee purchased AutoStore for $1.7 billion. The Nordic concern is considered one of the leaders in mechatronic logistics with 11,000 robots in operation across 28 countries. A few months later, Denmark-based Blue Ocean Robotics acquired American telepresence leader Beam Technologies. Northern Europe has a history of automation success stories with the founding of Universal Robotics and MiR (Mobile Industrial Robots) both owned today by publicly-traded Teradyne. One of the big backers of the local startup economy is Copenhagen’s venture capital firm Nordic Eye. In the words of the firm’s Chief Executive, Michael Tandrup, “The first time I came here, I thought maybe I’d be shaking hands with a person who’d turn out to be a robot! But everything on display was arm robots. I was actually kind of disappointed.

Last week, a major study found that London’s climate could be as hot as Barcelona’s by 2050. The study projected a global average temperature increase of 2°C over the next thirty years with London expected to rise in temperature by nearly 6°C. Though, anyone who has seen David Attenborough’s more recent documentaries will not be blindly seduced by the prospect of year-round sangrias and sun-tanning alongside the Thames — an increasingly hotter planet will be catastrophic and, to keep the global average temperature increase below 1.5­°C, current fossil fuel emissions will need to be almost halved. That’s an enormous expectation for a global economy that currently gets 87% of its energy from fossil fuels. Moving to renewable energy sources and mitigating the effects of climate change require solutions from the tech sector. So, naturally, the first thing we did when the headline came out was take a look at the patents being filed to help keep London’s winters abysmally cold. Arguably, the first patent for climate change was filed by a bloke named William Schaeffer for a method of using alum, sulphate, potash and salt to remove fatty and greasy contents from the waterways in 1850s Bradford. Patents for renewable energy, on the other hand, first sprouted as far back as 19th century when the patent for one of the earliest windmill motors were filed in 1883. In the same year, New York inventor, Charles Fritts, developed a solar cell by thinly coating selenium with gold. Then, only five years later, Edward Weston successfully registered two patents for his improvements on the solar cell, which transformed ‘radiant energy derived from the sun into electrical energy’. Unsurprisingly, alternative energy patents were few and far between for most of the 20th century but flourished in the 1970s after two of the world’s most severe petroleum shortages in ’74 and ’79. Following these crises, which put much of the West into economic recession, a surge of time and money was spent by government and business to generate alternative supplies of energy. Some countries risked an HBO series-worthy disaster and invested in nuclear tech. France, for example, increased the proportion of national energy supply from nuclear power to 40% in 1985 from 4% ten years earlier. But the crises also spurred on the visionaries — which is a fancy name for oil executives who knew gas was going to be very expensive very soon — to expand on the solar technology first pioneered by Fritts and Weston. Exxon, Mitsubishi and even NASA soon became some of the biggest filers of solar patents and, after Exxon inventor, Dr. Elliot Berman, discovered that you could make a cheaper solar cell by using silicon from multiple crystals rather than from just a single crystal, the price of cells went down fivefold. The market demand for solar innovation subsequently skyrocketed and the industry enjoyed its golden age of patenting. After a nosedive in the 80s, solar patents had a second boom with a gradual take-off in the 90s — but for a different reason. Scientists had been publishing studies on climate change throughout the last century, but it was only in the 90s that the community began establishing large networks of experts to convey the impending consequences of anthropogenic climate change. This had an immense cultural effect which rejuvenated the demand for, not only green tech, but also solutions to mitigate the irreversible effects from a century of burning fossil fuels. While we are obliged to give some credit to Al Gore for bringing climate to the public discourse, the single biggest factor that drove the second cycle of climate related patent filings since the 70s was the 2005 international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions — the Kyoto Protocol. This event generated a sudden rallying of patent filings globally, which continued until recent years. On top of this, the patents from the 70s were almost all expired, and this cleared the way for companies to expand on the existing technology that was previously protected. Things are different these days. Driving an electric car and being eco-friendly is cool now and businesses are making climate change a top priority with investment going into reducing their carbon footprint. In fact, after Britain went a week without using any coal power back in May, there’s hope that technology can save the planet after all. So, in the face of the recent study, who is going to keep up the momentum of green tech innovation? Well, out of the 2.1 million patents relating to climate change mitigation worldwide, China has the lead with 730,000 of the patents filed in their IP office. The UK office, on the other hand, only received 38,000 of these filings. It might be because the Chinese government is simply more ambitious with its renewable energy targets than most Western states; by next year, it plans to generate 20% of its electricity from renewable sources and will have spent $360 billion of taxpayer money in doing so — the equivalent of Hong Kong’s GDP! Going forward, we can expect conventional renewable energy to continue becoming cheaper and more widespread. But what about novel green energies like, say, perpetual motion? A recent patent filing for a gravity-lever actuated rotating engine shows that inventors haven’t given up on eliminating their electricity bill altogether. Regrettably, we’re with Homer on this one.

Raincheck Demo Explainer Video — YouTube http://bit.ly/2PGzcnL RainCheck unites online shoppers with offline purchases, generating an on-demand shopping experience. RainCheck aims to deliver solutions on the online shopping problem; majority of people are now browsing products online, but only few close the purchase. Co-Founder and CEO Cameron Wall says, ‘We found that there was a lot of people obviously saving items into their list. I think the average basket size from online was about just over a hundred dollars but the average basket size in store was probably 2.5 times the size of that.’ With 90 percent of people researching new products online, 90 percent of purchases continue to take place in offline in-store. The company has built, designed and launched its RainCheck app which facilitates people to use their mobile device to choose a brand, save preferred items in a shopping cart to a ‘wishlist’, where users then receive notifications when a product is available in nearby stores. Cameron Wall states, ‘Raincheck is transcending online to offline so it’s a layer that plays that whole ecosystem.’ As we are living in an online world, people are taking on a multichannel approach when shopping, hence much more focus should be pointed to transforming the online shopping to in-store purchasing. ‘I think there’s a big opportunity for everyone’s discovering things online. But let’s try and work out what store they went into when they went there whether we converted them and if they actually bought the item. I think that’s more important for brands to understand that’, says Cameron Wall. Digital devices have a significant influence on in-store sales according to GeoMarketing, Mobile phones will influence $1.4 trillion in offline sales within the next 5 years. The sales that Mobile influenced in 2016 account for over one-third of total retail in online and offline sales. (GeoMarketing) Retail has shifted to using technology to close the sales to an extent that it is both contextual and consistent. RainCheck creates relationships with consumers and assists in determining the sale and retail journey, making it personal. RainCheck transcends the future for retailers to establish balance of power, measure the online to offline conversion of sales and target online users that ensue in-store activity and purchases. ‘Our original mission is transcending the online and offline worlds and that’s what we’re focused on and everything that happens around that’, says Cameron Wall. RainCheck is a digital channel that transforms the digital and physical systems of retail shopping. For the consumers, there is the opportunity to obtain both an online shopping request and an in-store experience. https://www.getraincheck.com/home/ https://www.raintoken.org/ by Boardroom.media Tags: demo, online-to-offline, Retail, retail tech -- -- Creative Technologist , Mobile innovator, evangelist & creator who is living in the future and building what's missing.

This is my first article here. As you have already noticed, this is about a python script which I wrote few months back to save time and process a large amount of Sentinel images from Open Access Hub. The goal was to download Sentinel 1 images, preprocess and store them for further analysis. Since a lot of these analysis involve trials-and-errors spreading among various other softwares, I tried to put on the best practice and avoid complexities. At first you should get a free registration at Copernicus Open Access Hub to download images. It’s free. The Hub lets us download images with their API, but only two images per account at this time. I have also used a Python library called Sentinelsat for that because it’s easier to work with. Then I used Snappy, a python-binding of a very useful and free remote sensing software called SNAP. SNAP comes in both 32 and 64-bit. Binding SNAP with the existing Python installation needs some effort. Since I already have 64-bit Python installed by ArcGIS Pro, I cloned a separate Python environment and installed Snappy in it. Snappy helps us to access most of the functionalities of SNAP programmatically. The steps to install Snappy is here. Now, let the script do the talking. A lot can be done to this code ! The geojson file is created from a very generalised shapefile of Bangladesh by using ArcGIS Pro. There are a lot of free online tools to convert shapefile to geojson and WKT. The steps of processing raw files of Sentinel-1 used here are not the most generic way, note that there are no authentic way for this. Since different research require different steps to prepare raw data, you will need to follow yours. -- -- Self-inspired researcher who likes to read everything Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/2*AlyJw8Rx9TEFW_v2Mvjowg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/2*AlyJw8Rx9TEFW_v2Mvjowg.jpeg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/2*AlyJw8Rx9TEFW_v2Mvjowg.jpeg"

As I am currently in graduate school seeking to understand the world of mobility, I figured there is no better place to take a deep dive than in the hottest issue of today, autonomous vehicles. I will be reviewing No One at the Wheel by Sam Schwartz, an eminent transportation technologist and leader with a long pedigree, characterized by the quality of his work and his New York roots. Schwartz starts the book by saying that the money and talent in the world of today and the recent future is in the AV industry. As he explains, eras of transportation come in waves, usually with an economic incentive attached. The book covers autonomous cars and how they will affect both transportation and society. For example: Or What could you take away from the previous scenario? Sam Schwartz is a renowned traffic engineer who served as former NYC Traffic Commissioner and Chief Engineer of the NYC Department of Transportation. He has made a career out of emphasizing pedestrian safety and non-invasive interventions to difficult traffic problems. He is currently the President and CEO of Sam Schwartz Engineering, a firm which specializes in transportation planning and engineering. So, there is no doubt you are in good hands when reading this book about AVs and the future of transportation. Schwartz places the advent of AVs within the greater conversation of traffic and land use planning in the United States. The first chapter details the revolutions in transportation in America in the late 19th and 20th century, new technologies like streetcars, and cars, and especially how the latter ended up influencing life and policy on a large scale. What used to be pedestrian centered urban design, ended up prioritizing cars by the middle of the 20th century. This on rush of car activity, among other things, led to higher fatalities due to car usage. At the same time, these kind of fatalities were and can be mitigated by the effective use of planning and zoning, not necessarily advanced technology. Schwartz goes back to this point throughout the book, most notably when he speaks to transportation professor Alain Kornhauser, who is quoted in the book saying that the safety objective of eliminating car crash fatalities can be solved with safe driving (automated collision avoidance and lane keeping) and not the more advanced self-driving (essentially Level 4) or driverless (essentially Level 5) technology. Noting that the problem of human error is the leading factor in 94% of all car crashes in the US, this poses an interesting scenario for transportation planners seeking to solve the safety question: How can we plan now for safety, with a future of AVs in mind? Ideally, planning that works in present environments would hold up against new technologies. Schwartz lays out the kind of future that we can have with autonomous vehicles. One of the most salient examples is that of a for-hire car service that allows people to hail an autonomous car just for when driving to a certain location is needed. People would be discouraged from owning, which could have very positive effects overall. However, the choice presented here is similar to others throughout the book, there is a good way and a not-so-good way to go about these advancements, and it’s up to us to take action. That being said, Schwartz still sees AVs playing a huge part in our lives, by virtue of how it will change our lives. This new technology will overturn a trucking industry that employs 1 out of 7 Americans, open up new challenges in data sharing and privacy, and will be the grounds for new kinds of insurance, laws and public policies. One potential future could be using a version of the EU’s GDPR (Global Data Protection Regulations) to keep private data on autonomous vehicles, or at least have a defined process for how to use these data to forward other aims, like pedestrian safety. Like the Internet or cryptocurrency, this new technology will move faster than policy, so there is a relatively short window where we can act intelligently and collectively to set up beneficial rules in place for broader society. What these rules will look like is uncertain, however, there are other kinds of actions that planners, engineers and others can take when setting up a future for autonomous vehicles. Two things that Schwartz makes mention of are limiting the number of parking spaces in an urban area, and limiting our discouraging people from owning autonomous vehicles. To the first point, getting rid of parking in theory opens up more roadway for cars, and in reality does ease the congestion process. To the second point, the danger of AVs would be in their potential accessibility and popularity, leading to a surge in AV ownership, which would only increase the congestion on our roadways, in a version of the “induced demand” phenomenon where roadways are widened only to result in more cars and congestion on the road. At the same time, there are clear benefits to oncoming AV technology, and as no-nonsense as much of this book can be, there are things to be hopeful for. One of these is the prospect of linking the new AV technology network with public transit, creating new and easier transportation options for more people. Throughout the book, Schwartz maintains a cautious, if not pessimistic, view of how we relate to cars and the kind of changes we can expect to see with the rise of AV technology. His book is as wide-eyed and curious as it is hard-nosed and even austere at times. Regardless, it is clear from this book that the time to act is NOW if we want to build our most desirable future. This means that we have to make certain decisions now. There is time for people to contribute to this oncoming reality without being part of one of the major technological players pushing this lifestyle change. With this in mind, this is still a huge and emergent field with a massive opportunity for growth and new, creative ideas. After reading this book, it is clear that we can’t relegate the decision making power to one particular group or interest, but rather people to work together to define and solve problems that are larger than any one discipline — technical or otherwise — can reasonably handle on their own. Needed are traditional traffic planners and engineers, designers, business leaders, technologists and developers, advocates, government leaders and everyday citizens. In my opinion, there is no better time to learn about AVs than right now. News is coming in everyday, and the fact that what is in vogue in the industry is influx is exciting. Especially now, as the hype about the technology has died down somewhat, the setting has been laid for a more complete and constructive discussion of this new technology and its implications.

But ever since I was a child, I was especially fascinated by these big inventions, powered by transformative technological revolution that changed - everything! I loved to imagine how it felt living through one of these transitions — the airplane, the car, the radio, the telephone, the TV, … So I felt extremely lucky, when about 20 years ago, at the beginning of my career, I was just in time for one of these revolutions: when the Internet happened. Through the connected PC, the world we lived in has been transformed from a “physical world” — where we used to go to places like libraries, and use things like encyclopedias and paper maps, to a “digital world” — where we consume digital information and services from the convenience of our home. What was especially amazing, was the rate and scale of this transformation. Within a very short time, hundreds of millions of users were connected to hundreds of millions online services. The key to enabling such rate and scale of change, was the emergence of new platforms: browsers and Search engines on the client, and data centers in the cloud. These were optimized for scale. Combined, they connected between users and websites at an unforeseen scale. New industries emerged, and old industries were disrupted. It seemed like a revolution of a lifetime. But less than 10 years later, another transformation took place, which seemed to be an even bigger revolution. 10 years after the connected PC changed our world forever, the mobile internet happened. The device changed a bit— the clunky PC shrunk to a pocket-sized device, and its network cables were cut loose. The internet now became available also in countries where landlines didn’t exist, growing from hundreds of millions of users, mostly in US and Western Europe, to Billions of people from all around the world. Whole continents experienced the internet “mobile first”. As the device was no longer stationary, but rather followed the user wherever she went, usage exploded. It quickly became the most used device in the history of man kind, Basically, 24/7. Moreover, as new sensors were added — camera, mic, GPS, gyros, accelerometer — totally new classes of apps and interactions emerged: selfie, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Twitter, checking-in a location, mobile payments, walking directions, email on the go, …. Once again, this happened at unprecedented speed and scale, powered by platforms of scale. This time it was the smartphone OSs, and Mobile App-stores on the client, and Cellular networks in the back. Combined, they brought the power of mobile apps and websites to billions. A third transformation is happening now, and it’s powered by AI. I like to think of it as the “paradigm shift to Natural UI (User Interface)”. Through the power of AI, people can start interacting with machines in the same “natural” way we interact with each other: communicate in natural language (in both directions), augment the conversation by showing and pointing at things, rely heavily on implicit context and memory, and enjoy elements of “personality” — humor, opinions, … We are shifting from a world where humans had to adapt to machines, to a world where machines adapt to humans. This time, the connected device is not “just” changing — it’s disappearing all together. We are no longer interacting with a physical device, but rather with an ambient AI entity that can be accessed from… everywhere! Again, in the same “natural” manner that we communicate with people via multiple channels. But will this change our lives like the previous two revolutions? I Believe it will. Similar to the previous two transformations, this has the potential to unlock mega-scale expansion across three dimensions: In order to power this change, new platforms of scale need to emerge. Platforms, that similarly to browsers and smartphone OSs, will connect services and users at scale, Platforms that will unlock the power of Natural UI, while hiding the underlying complexity involved from both users and service providers. Digital assistants are emerging as these disruptive platforms. It’s still early days for these platforms, and there is still a long way until they fully fulfill their potential. But we can already see some key elements of Natural UI at work — spanning speech recognition, natural language & context understanding, image recognition, and more. You can watch a live demonstration of these capabilities in a talk that I gave, in the video below (jump to 13:10 — https://youtu.be/SDxs6aWVads?t=790). It’s untampered examples of the Google Assistant on my Android Pixel 1 phone. There is no photoshop or tricks here, and all the examples should work on your phone as well: To sum it up: the age of AI and Assistants is coming, and it will be as transformative as the Internet and the Mobile revolutions.

As much as I hated what I was doing back then, I couldn’t afford to leave it. I had been unemployed for nearly a year before taking the job. I had gotten fired from that job too, and I had burned through all my savings and maxed out my credit cards. When I had started job number four, I was already working two jobs just to have money for the mortgage and food. I wasn’t bankrupt, but I had less than twenty dollars to my name. Until that point I had spent my working life predominantly in manufacturing, making parts for the appliance and automotive industries. Manufacturing was a hard job; I got into the factory early and left late, it was a dark and dirty floor, and my co-workers were a rough, easily irritable lot. Also, at that time many of the big American manufacturers were just discovering how cheap the labor was in China, so the manufacturing jobs were starting to leave the country, never to return. I thought about all this sitting at the bar, after being escorted off the property. And I realized that manufacturing wasn’t a good career for me. So, now what? I thought about what I did I was actually good at, and that people would pay for. At the job I had just left, my boss had our IT staff set up a Microsoft Access database for tracking quality control. One of the projects I had been assigned during my time there was to expand the database to include inspection results for incoming raw materials. It ws the lone bright spot of my tenure there. Not only did I good job at it, I was actually engrossed with the work. At one point, I had spent an entire night perfecting the user experience. Not because I was facing a deadline, but because I couldn’t go to bed until I had tweaked just one more feature to perfection. I also thought back to previous jobs. I always seemed to be the one who was comfortable around computers. The secretaries were always coming to me to ask me to show them how to do something in Word or Excel. Even the engineers were asking me how to make the computer do something that seemed hard. I was good with computers. And anyone living in the 21st century knows that people pay good money to work with computers. I enrolled for a certification program, but the sole benefit from that was getting my foot in the door for my first IT job. Once I got in, I kept studying more in my spare time to expand my knowledge base. I also sought out other coding professionals to learn more, not just about coding, but also about the trade of coding: managing projects, working with users, communicating effectively with stakeholders, and many other “soft” skills. It took years of learning, but switching careers from factories to computers took me from the edge of bankruptcy to a six-figure salary with NASDAQ-listed companies. I want to share that knowledge with you. You may just be starting out in coding. You may be working an entry-level technician’s job. I can teach you both the hard and soft skills you need to go from 40 to 60 thousand, to making a six-figure salary yourself. Yes, you could find this information yourself on StackExchange, Reddit, or Udemy. But it will take you a lot of time, and you will make many mistakes along the way.

Technology has redefines sensitive aspect of the education sector and no one knows what is next in stock. Talking about undergraduate project research now, technology has redefined how it is done; certainly, as new technologies emerge, the society and everything that influences it tilt forward to flow with the new cycle. To this point, it has not just influenced teaching and learning processes, it also redefined how resource materials are retrieved, stored, recycled and beneficial financially. Maybe we should talk discuss it individually right? Research Long gone are the days of sitting in the library for God-knows-how-long, flipping through pages of papers and probably end up with nothing meaningful. That doesn’t mean that search engines are taking over physical libraries totally, it’s just that it has diversified and as such modified how and where undergraduate students search out resource materials for their undergraduate project. Storage and retrieval There has never been a better and safer place to store students’ undergraduate project. What was obtainable was piling up projects and burning them after few years or months atleast. Google drive is available for saving digital projects, email too, cloud, flash drive and other advanced saving devices. The sweet part is that it is durable and portable no matter how many. Recycling Because research projects is now durable, it can be recycled; how? Well, if I may ask, what exactly do you do when you search for undergraduate projects and research materials online? If these resource materials are not recycled, you wouldn’t have them there; maybe you would be cuing up in your lecturer’s office by now, begging to have your project fixed. Without mincing words, technology has been the change that education has become and I suppose that more is yet to come. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams","https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/0*mBj4GKuL5XnuvJoG.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*mBj4GKuL5XnuvJoG.jpg, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*mBj4GKuL5XnuvJoG.jpg"

Hoe halen wij het dan in ons hoofd om er één ver buiten onze postcode te vinden? Ik heb het namelijk over LDRs of ook wel gekend als long-distance relationships. Zelf heb ik in één gezeten en geloof me, het is meer dan schattige emojis en gifs sturen om je partner te laten weten dat je aan hem/haar denkt. Ben je een millennial dan is de kans groot dat je zelf ook in één zit of in één terecht zal komen. Een combinatie van technologie, jongeren en liefde is iets waar websites en onderzoekers gretig over schrijven. Keuzestress, hookups, swipen… woorden waarmee we vaak geassocieerd worden. Ons datinggedrag blijkt fascinerend te zijn. Maar als je alles eens goed van dichtbij bekijkt, dan merk je toch dat er zaken ontbreken. Er valt veel te zeggen over ons (online) datinggedrag, maar waar blijven nu die artikels over hoe wij langeafstandsrelaties ervaren in dit digitale tijdperk? Naast het bestellen van schoenen en kleren op websites, het afspelen van zelfgemaakte playlists op streamingplatformen en het continue taggen van vrienden in herkenbare memes zijn we nu ook (romantische) relaties aan het opbouwen met iemand die ver weg van ons woont. En dit allemaal met behulp van technologie. Nu we alsmaar meer en meer digitaal met elkaar verbonden zijn, en grenzen ons niet kunnen tegenhouden, weerhoudt het ons ook niet om met iemand te praten die ver weg woont. Was dit dan ook niet de bedoeling van technologie? Om het leven wat gemakkelijker te maken en om afstand te overbruggen? Door continu met elkaar te communiceren, en tijdzones te negeren, verbaast het mij ook niet dat sommigen liefde vinden in de verste hoeken. De meest voorkomende situatie, voor millenials, is het vinden van liefde tijdens het reizen of tijdens een uitwisseling. Plots merk je iemand op die jou wel interessant lijkt, je wisselt usernames uit (telefoonnummers vragen is blijkbaar passé), volgt elkaar op Instagram, Snapchat of Facebook en het communiceren kan beginnen. Na enige tijd merk je wel dat je dit niet zomaar kan loslaten en dat je effectief iets voor dat persoon voelt. Zelf heb ik dit mogen meemaken tijdens mijn Erasmus uitwisseling. Maar het avontuur begint past echt na die 6 maanden. Het mag dan wel goed klikken, maar hoe gaan wij dit volhouden wanneer we allebei terug naar huis gaan? Het zit niets anders op dan een langeafstandsrelaties aan te gaan. Ze hebben altijd al bestaan, het is dus niks nieuw. Al was het vroeger dan toch wel een pak lastiger. Ik mag van geluk spreken dat ik niet moet sukkelen met het trainen van postduiven. Of erger nog, dagen (soms zelfs maanden) moet wachten op brieven van mijn lover(s). Ik maak deel uit van een generatie die wel nog geduld kan uitoefenen maar ook wel beseft dat onze behoeftes instant bevredigd kunnen worden door de beschikbare tools en apps. Wil ik een movie night maar mijn partner woont te ver? Geen probleem! We kunnen samen, op afstand, een filmpje kijken en elkaars gezichtsuitdrukkingen zien. En dit allemaal dankzij Let’sGaze. Wil ik weten hoe het zou zijn moest ik mijn hoofd op zijn borstkas leggen? Pillow Talk tot de redding. Hiermee kan ik mijn partner zijn hartritme horen (maar wel via een speaker in mijn armband). Creepy? Zeker en vast. Maar dit toont aan dat er effectief tools en apps zijn die de afstand proberen te verkleinen. Wanneer ons dit allemaal te veel wordt kunnen we gewoon overschakelen naar de iets meer ‘normale’ apps zoals Facebook, WhatsApp en Instagram. Het lijkt wel alsof er geen redenen zijn om niet een langeafstandsrelatie aan te gaan. Dat we theoretisch gezien iemand (beter) kunnen leren kennen door regelmatig via die apps te communiceren. Toch ervaren velen diep van binnen het gevoel van een afwezigheid en afstand. Ondanks alle beschikbare tools en de mogelijkheid om gratis met iemand op afstand te communiceren, is er één belangrijk aspect dat moeilijk of niet nagebootst kan worden via technologie. Aanraking. Wat wij nodig hebben is meer dan woorden alleen. Onbewust communiceren we ook via aanraking, stemgeluiden, gezichtsuitdrukkingen, lichaamstaal,... wat toch al moeilijker is om (precies) na te bootsen. Dat het ontbreken van fysieke intimiteit uiteindelijk de reden was dat mijn LDR (long distance relationship) niet meer ging, is dan ook geen verrassing. Het is alsof mijn onbewuste wist dat al die apps en tools het gevoel van een warme knuffel of een gepassioneerde kus niet kan en mag vervangen. Het blijft belangrijk dat er een concreet plan wordt opgesteld in langeafstandsrelaties. Effectief samen zijn in de (nabije) toekomst zou the “final” goal moeten zijn. Net zoals elke relatie, zijn LDRs redelijk gevarieerd en complex. Maar zeg nu zelf… het idee dat liefde wereldwijd gevonden kan worden, in het tijdperk van keuzestress, instant gratification, globalisatie en zo veel meer, toont aan hoe gedurfd millennials wel niet zijn. -- -- OpenVRT is een community voor jonge, digitale creatievelingen met een broek vol goesting in media.
